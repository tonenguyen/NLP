101005,"I wish I had written this review about a year ago, soon after I purchased this tool for a much higher price, because it might have caused others to stop and think more carefully about buying this boat anchor.  If you don't care about accuracy, don't care about the ability to drill holes repeatedly, and don't care about the ability to easily drill in hardwood, this is the tool for you.  I had already used the Kreg jig quit a bit and was pretty happy with it.  Its shortcomings to me were 1) difficulty in adjusting for different wood thicknesses, 2) no ""on-board"" stop for repetitive operations, 3) spacing between holes not adjustable, 4) sometimes hard, and a trial and error process, to change hole depth.  This Porter Cable 560 seemed to address the first three of these issues.  Generally, I work with 3/4 stock (or sometimes 2 X 4s) so I don't often need to adjust for thickness.  The stop on the Porter Cable would be nice if it did really ensure repeatable holes.  Holes on the right side are pretty much repeatable.  But, holes on the left side are not where they should be because of the flaky mechanism which has way to much slop.  Similarly, the Porter Cable adjustable hole spacing would be nice if the holes actually came out where indicated by the marks on top where you set the spacing.  But they do not, again due to the mechanism.  For what I do, exact hole spacing is usually not an issue. In a recent case, however, I needed to keep a hole away from a slot in the edge.  The slot would receive a 1/4 panel when the pocket holes were joined.  I could have avoided this concern by making a ""stopped"" slot.  But, this is a lot of work.  Despite carefully aligning the left hole clearly away from the slot and carefully lining up the board against the stop, some holes drifted into the slot a little bit.  This is non-repeatabiliy due to the slop in the device.  As for the ability to work with hardwoods, I find it difficult to apply enough force to power the bit through using the Porter Cable.  I don't have nearly as much trouble using the Kreg.  Long ago, I gave up using a battery powered drill to make pocket holes.  I use a corded drill bigger than your standard drill so it's not for lack of power that drilling in hardwood is so difficult.  I think that either the guide bushings or the furnished bit (or both) are dull.  I thought I try to use one of my Kreg bits to sort this out but you can't because the Porter Cable bit is significantly longer.  I haven't really used this tool that much and much of my work has been in pine which drills ""okay"".  I usually make a pine model of something before I use hardwood because there are almosts always ""oops"" that show up during the model buildup.  Almost always, when you have to use more pressure to drill with the Porter Cable, the hole on the left is somewhat closer (deeper) to the edge of the board than the right hole.  This affects hole depth and perhaps screw holding ability.  However, I have never had a screw break through the receiving board because the hole was too deep.  This is again cause by the flaky mechanism and slop.  When using the Porter Cable, you control the depth of the hole by pressing the drill bushing against a metal plate that moves with the drill until you reach the correct depth.  This requires that you apply even more force when drilling - force to move the drill and force to push the plate down.  I work around this by simply compressing the plate fully down with my left hand while drilling with my right.  When you look at how this mechanism actually works to limit the hole depth, you can see how flimsy it is and why hole depths can easily vary.  A significant limitation of the Porter Cable tool is that you can't manually adjust the hole depth.  Why would one want to do that anyway.  Here's why.  Sometimes I need to use a different length of screw than recommended.  In a recent case, the standard screw length for 3/4 wood is 1 1/4.  When I tested this screw on my project, I didn't get enough bite because the screw ended up in the slot I discribed above.  When I simply tried a 1 1/2 screw, I got better bite, but the end of the screw was uncomfortably close to breaking out of the receiving board.  The goal of a ""perfect"" pocket hole is that it exit the board at the center of the board.  The Porter Cable tool does this well.  What I needed was to adjust the depth of the hole so that the exit point was a little above center so that a longer screw doesn't come as close to breaking out.  The Porter Cable can't be adjusted.  The Kreg jig can be, but it is not a simple process.  One has to adjust the drilling block up, toward a thinner wood setting (normally, it would be set for 3/4 if using 3/4 stock).  And then, you have to also adjust where the bushing is on the drill bit.  So, a bit of trial and error and testing, but doable.  A final compaint against both the Kreg and Porter Cable drill bits is that they use only one setscrew to hold the bushing.  I've already had a bushing slip.  Larger setscrews should also be used so that it's harder to strip them out.  I was wowed by the potential of this tool, but for me, it is useless, I'm using the Kreg for everything that I really care about.  The reason that the Porter Cable is now so much cheaper than when I paid over $200 for it is either that they can't sell it for that price or they're coming out with a new and improved model.",2.0,0,"[0.21666666666666667, 0.43333333333333335, 0.525, -0.18055555555555558, 0.25, 0.05000000000000002, 0.4, 0.24523809523809526, 0.1, 0.275, -0.125, 0.1875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.057499999999999996, -0.125, -0.25, -0.2, -0.05, -0.16666666666666666, -0.2916666666666667, 0.375, 0.2, -0.25, 0.2619047619047619, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.17222222222222222, 0.03253968253968253, 0.21666666666666667, 0.375, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0, -0.09583333333333333, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.09999999999999999, 0.16818181818181818]",1,1

101047,For the most part this machine is a good compromise that does a fairly good job but not  great one. It's great for hobby/small wood working projects but nothing on a larger scale. One problem I have is with the miter gauge. It does not slide in the channels smoothly and does not hold a setting very well. It's actually very cheaply made and not adequate for a job that requires any degree of accuracy. In searching for a better after-market miter gauge I found that Rockwell has designed this saw with what are apparently one-of-a-kind channels. I contacted Rockwell Customer Service via E-mail and asked about after-market gauges and how to acquire a replacement OEM gauge and was told that Rockwell does not sell after-market parts and they didn't bother addressing the OEM gauge question at all. Basically: &#34;Sorry about your luck!&#34; In addition while looking for a OEM gauge I found that several repair parts for the BladeRunner have been discontinued and are no longer available.

101394,"Well, I said this is the worst excuse for a light I've got. Actually its a tie with the all plastic lighted screwdriver with a hand crank that you have to crank to make the lights work.This one has the weirdest design I've ever seen for one, and about the worst made. First the little door or cover that you have to remove to put the batteries in is very difficult to get off. I just about had to break it to get the thing off. Then once I got batteries in it the on/off switch is really flaky. It tends to turn on and off just by handling the light. The worst thing about it is the base. I made the mistake of sticking it in the heavy base to see how it would look when standing on the table. Then when I tried to take it out of the base I found it was almost impossible. I had to find one of my biggest widest flat blade screwdrivers and use it to work down between the back of the base the the light and pry the light out of the base. I almost had to break the thing before I could get that stupid base off.

101396,"I had never previously used a book light, but I thought one would be nice to read in bed on those nights where my spouse or children are in my room and trying to fall asleep.When I opened the package, the first thing I noted was that the light does not come with batteries.  I grabbed 2 AAA batteries and attempted to pop open the battery cover.  I found the battery cover very difficult to open and resorted to depressing the little tab and prying the cover off with a flathead screwdriver.The book light does exactly as advertises.  It does light up a book.  When clipped to a book, the light created roughly a 5 inch by 3 inch oval of light.  There is enough ambient light coming from the beam of light to be able to read most of the page of a large hardcover book quite easily.  Only the very fringes of the page were a bit dark, but still readable.However, with use, I found that I did not particularly care for this book light.  The attached magnifying glass and the design of the clip give the light a large, awkward, clunky feel.  When I clipped the light to a hardcover book, I found it worked fine, but the added weight made it necessary to find a good, stable rest if reading the book for more than a few minutes.  The light was too heavy and awkward to use with a softcover book.While my eyesight with glasses is fine, I opted to give the magnifying glass a try.  I clipped the light to a hard cover book and put the magnifying glass into place.  The field of view with the magnifying glass is small.  I was unable to read an entire line of text without shifting the magnifying glass around.  Also, the magnifying glass is circular shaped with thinner edges, resulting in a fish-eye effect.  When it comes to reading text, I found the magnifying glass pretty useless.  I would much rather opt for my prescription glasses or those cheap over the counter glasses from the drug store.With very limited use, I then began having issues with the light.  When I would lightly bump the clip area or even clip the light to a book, the light would go off.  In order to get it working again, I would have to remove the battery cover and reseat the batteries.  As I mentioned before, the battery cover is tough to get off and as I do not feel like searching for a screwdriver every time this happens, my thumbnail is getting all chewed up from opening the cover.So what is this light good for?  If you use the attached base and are reading at a desk or a similar stationary area, the light is not bad at all.  Also, if you are doing precision work at a stationary location where a magnifying glass would be useful, then this would be a nice set.  However, I feel in each of these scenarios, there are better products than this light.This is one of the few times where I have to say that I feel a product I was lucky enough to review is destined for the trash.  My light does not work reliably and it is too heavy and awkward to clip to a book in my opinion.  I would have given the product a second star for its limited application of close up work, but the reliability of this product is an issue for me.

I'm revising my previous 4-star review down to 2 stars because this flashlight has now become almost as useless as a battery-powered flashlight if I have to maintain it like this.(Original review: Feb. 22, 2012): Hey! It's a flashlight! At it's most basic, that's really all you need to know. It lights up and it's actually surprisingly bright (but in a somewhat small pattern that you might expect given the size of the head.)  The unusual thing about it is, obviously, that it's solar powered.  Install the portable-phone style battery into the backside of the flashlight and stick it in a window, black-side out, for a day, and you'll have a fully charged flashlight.  Handy for those times when you need a flashlight that just works - you know how it goes, the power goes out and you grab for a flashlight only to find that the batteries are dead.  That shouldn't be the case with this one, claiming to hold a charge for a full year (obviously I haven't been able to test that yet) and working for up to 4 hours at a time.  Other little pluses are that it's extremely light (due to not being burdened with all those large batteries) and has a could-be handy carabiner clip built in to the end to hang on various things - belt hooks, etc.  There really aren't any downsides that I can find so far other than that if you need an extremely bright, wide-patterned light, this isn't it.  This is a good light for simple light-duty use around the house or in a car.",2.0,0,"[0.15, 0.05, -0.9750000000000001, 0.0, -0.2740740740740741, 0.375, 0.0, 0.2333333333333333, 0.22500000000000003, 0.1, -0.16666666666666666, 0.13333333333333333, 0.2833333333333333, 0.11096938775510204, 0.1958333333333334, 0.375]",1,1

101532,"UPDATE 9/11/12The first bulb I bought which I installed in my central hallway has burned out after a little more than 2 months of use.  It was installed on July 4th and burned out on September 11th.  My hall light is on most of the time (it is really only out when no-one is at home).  I would estimate the bulb lasted 600-800 hours....very disappointing.----- earlier reviewNot much to say about this product.  It does appear to be the same brightness as a 50W bulb as advertised.  I placed this one in my central hallway which is lit almost all the time I'm home (I previously had a CFL in that location).  In 10 years I think this fixture has had two CFL's replaced since it's on about 14 hours a day (it's off when I leave for work).  The light is a slightly yellow warm white.The nice thing about this bulb is that it is almost exactly the same form factor as regular lightbulb, so it should be able to fit in any normal fixture.  This was a problem in one of my bathrooms with a very tiny fixture. I think a good pricepoint for this type of light would be about $5-$7.  The current $10 (at the time I'm writing this) is a little bit high, but would be fine if you need it for a fixture that is lit most of the day.It would have a cost savings even against a CFL, and certainly against a regular bulb.  If you are replacing a conventional incandescent bulb, this bulb should have a pay-back time of only about 1400 hours if your local electrical cost is $0.12/kW-hr.  If you replacing a CFL this would have a much longer payback time (several years), since a CFL is already very efficient.  If you factor in the cost of the CFL, and that these last much longer than a fluorescent bulb, the payback gets much better, again on the order of 1000-2000 hours (depending on the life-span and cost of the CFL you are replacing).You should be aware that while these bulb have an extremely long life span (great for those really hard to reach fixtures), they do very gradually get dimmer over the years.",1.0,0,"[0.140625, 0.0, 0.3, -0.19333333333333336, 0.0, -0.08333333333333333, 0.0, 0.2636363636363636, 0.0, 0.55, 0.1576360544217687, -0.03571428571428571, 0.13333333333333333, 0.20104166666666665]",1,1

Unfortunately they are not compatible with the SC-100W.I purchased the SC-100W system, and the AA-433W audio alarm as an addition.  You have to program each sensor to each device.  The SC-100W has a delay after arming to allow you to leave the house.  There is no delay on the AA-433W, so make sure that if you are using both in a system, don't program the front door to the AA-433W.I'm not a fan of the mini 12V batteries they are using in these, they are a bit expensive, and a specialty item.  It's not a common battery.  I ordered 10 of these sensors new through Amazon Prime, and 3 came already opened, missing parts, and dead batteries.  The only place I know of that carries the mini 12VDC batteries is Radio Shack.Interesting as to how these use the mini 12VDC batteries, and the KP-434W keypad uses a CR2032 lithium.When programming these sensors, I used scotch tape to hold the magnets together while using the activation test button prior to istallation.  This is a good way to verify everything is working prior to installing the system.  If you build a system with a SC-100W control panel, and AA-433W audio alarm panel, you have to program each sensor to each device.  Remember that the AA-433W has no delay prior to arming as is the case with the SC-100W.Just got the system programmed, and installed.  I used the foamy tape included to attach these to the windows.  Some carpentry work was required to make room in the door jambs.  There's just barely enough clearance for the magnet on the garage door; screw it to the side of one of the panels, and make sure you clear the lift cable.I'm interested in how long the batteries last.UPDATE:  The AA-433W is instant on when arming, while the SC-100W has a 45 second delay for exiting the building.  You have to omit the exit door from the AA-433W if you're adding it into the system.  I cleared mine and they no longer recognize the arm/disarm commands from the SC-100W. You can only have one SC-100W control panel in the system.  You cannot add another at a remote location.

101779,"I've purchased Skylink products in that past with good results.  So I was hoping for something to rave about here.  What a pain it was.1.  As a homeowner, I want security from intruders.  The motion sensor that came with this system is still in the box.  With a dog in the house I didn't want the motion sensor going off when she got up and moved through the house at night.2. The SC-100W can accomodate 30 sensors and devices. The AA-433W can only accomodate 15 sensors and devices. So if you have a large house, a lot of windows and doors, adding the AA-433W will only cover 10-12 sensors depending on the number of other devices in the system.3.  Clearing and programming the different zones with the window/door sensors was easy and fast.  A lot of repetition entering the codes on the SC-100W keypad.4.  The keychain remote came already programmed to the SC-100W, so there was no issue there.5.  When adding the AA-433W audio alarm, it's not so easy.  Follow the instructions that come with the audio alarm.  Just adding the audio alarm to the control panel isn't enough.  You have to program the audio alarm to each sensor, and device you want it to communicate with.  If a sensor triggers the alarm at the control panel, the control panel will not trigger the audio alarm.  So for every device you add into this system, you have to build a system for the device with all the sensors and other devices you want it to interact with.  Also, the AA-433W does not have any sort of deplay as is the case with the SC-100W.  When you arm the system at the SC-100W, there's a 45 second dely to exit the house.  The AA-433W is armed instantly with no delay, so you have to omit the exit/entrance point from the AA-433W programming.  Other options are to mount a KP-434W outside in a protected location as it is not an indoor/outdoor device, or arm/disarm from the keychain remote only.6.  When adding the remote keypad to the SC-100W, follow the instructions that come with the keypad.  There are none in the SC-100W manual.  When adding the keypad to the AA-433W, get ready.  They tell you to press the panic button to program it to the AA-433W.  So when you program it, the SC-100W alarm goes off, and then the AA-433 alarm goes off.  My ears hurt for more than 20 minutes after that experience.7.  The alarm is LOUD!!  VERY LOUD!!8.  They don't tell you or show the antenna sticking out the top, or the DC power cord and wall wart.9.  When I sent off a request for further information to Skylink, they have yet to respond.  I called Skylink Tech support, and got no answer.  When I selected sales, the lady spoke to me like I should have know the differences, and gave em the impression she felt I was wasting her time.  Use that as a guage for customer service.CONs:  ""Accessories"" aren't really accessories.  They don't share all of the same functions as the SC-100W, and in some cases don't recognize the SC-100W commands. If the accessories would recognize half of the command functions of the SC-100W it would get better ratings from me.I have 2 AA433W audio alarms going in a box as spare parts as I've ordered 2 more SC-100W control panels to allow the exit delay throughout the system.  I could have saved $70 if Skylink would have advertised the arm/disarm differences on their site.UPDATE:  I purchased 2 more SC-100W control panels to provide a delay when exiting where the AA-433W audio alarms did not.  Contacted Skylink, and it's not possible to add more than one control panel into a system.  So those 2 control panels are going back.  Cleared the AA-433W's and reprogrammed them, and now neither one recognizes arm/disarm commands from the control panel, so they're going back.The review started out with 5 stars, and has fallen quickly.  If the batteries in the sensors don't last more than a month, it's going to fall again.",2.0,0,"[0.22499999999999998, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.029761904761904757, 0.2111111111111111, 0.0, -0.1, 0.43333333333333335, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05625, -0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.13, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.2777777777777778, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.16666666666666666, 0.25]",1,1

101822,"This sander was purchased to replace our Bosch after 7 years of cabinet shop use. Porter Cable makes one that looks just like this one. Took a risk and to save some money got this one. After sanding one small Maple top, I was disgusted with the swirl marks left behind. From the drum sander with 150 grit we finish with random orbit sanders, starting at 100 grit on up to 220, no skipping any. Even the 220 had terrible swirl marks. Also it lerches like I have never seen. Also seems to lack power.On the up side. None of us had any issues with holding it. Dust collection was the best I have ever seen on a RO sander.If your work calls for fine finishing you may want to avoid this sander. We have 2 other random orbit sanders and neither one has ever left a swirl mark like this one.Wish I knew if the Porter Cable version was any differant?? I will go back to the Bosch.",1.0,0,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.22999999999999998, -0.25, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7083333333333334, -0.20833333333333334, 0.0]",0,1
101827,"This is my second palm sander, my first was a porter cable (the pad came off and brushes went bad after many years of service).  I like this low profile.  I read another review that indicated this one was hard to hold onto but I did not find that to be true, though it wasn't totally comfortable, it was not hard to handle.  After I had just used this a few times over a 3 or 4 months, the sanding pad would stop under the slightest pressure,  i.e. it would just not sand anything.  Amazon customer support is excellent and they let me return it for a slight restocking fee (why I am not sure since it was defective).  I then bought a Makita which appears to be a better finishing sander , better quality and more ergonomic.",2.0,0,"[0.012500000000000039, 0.0, 0.001041666666666656, -0.2, 0.0, 0.19444444444444445, 0.5]",1,1
