      "537 well i said this is the worst excuse for a light i have got, actually its a tie with the all plastic lighted screwdriver with a hand crank that you have to crank to make the lights work this one has the weirdest design i have ever seen for one and about the worst made, first the little door or cover that you have to remove to put the batteries in is very difficult to get off, i just about had to break it to get the thing off, then once i got batteries in it the on off switch is really flaky, it tends to turn on and off just by handling the light, the worst thing about it is the base, i made the mistake of sticking it in the heavy base to see how it would look when standing on the table, then when i tried to take it out of the base i found it was almost impossible, i had to find one of my biggest widest flat blade screwdrivers and use it to work down between the back of the base the the light and pry the light out of the base, i almost had to break the thing before i could get that stupid base off, the worst of it is if you cant get the base off you cant change the batteries in it as for the light itself its the weakest worst excuse for a reading light i have ever tried to see with, a candle puts out more light than this does, the only thing that i have found on this that actually works like it is supposed to work is the magnifying glass, in the spring and summer kids should be able to have a ball playing with it and using it for the traditional ant burning i got it thinking it would be handy in my workshop either for doing fine detail work or seeing to dig slivers out of a finger things like that, but the light is not even half bright enough for anything like that i started with giving it only star and would have gave it a or but since the magnifying glass does work and is on a flexible thing so you do not have to try to hold it steady with your hands, making it easier to use it as a emergency fire starter hot foot helper and things like that i shall i will have to give it stars, or stars for the magnifying glass and minus a star for the flaky light 1.0 0  BlobText  -0.13475115740740742\n",

      "539 i had never previously used a book light but i thought one would be nice to read in bed on those nights where my spouse or children are in my room and trying to fall asleep when i opened the package the first thing i noted was that the light does not come with batteries, i grabbed aaa batteries and attempted to pop open the battery cover, i found the battery cover very difficult to open and resorted to depressing the little tab and prying the cover off with a flathead screwdriver the book light does exactly as advertises, it does light up a book, when clipped to a book the light created roughly a inch by inch oval of light, there is enough ambient light coming from the beam of light to be able to read most of the page of a large hardcover book quite easily, only the very fringes of the page were a bit dark but still readable however with use i found that i did not particularly care for this book light, the attached magnifying glass and the design of the clip give the light a large awkward clunky feel, when i clipped the light to a hardcover book i found it worked fine but the added weight made it necessary to find a good stable rest if reading the book for more than a few minutes, the light was too heavy and awkward to use with a softcover book while my eyesight with glasses is fine i opted to give the magnifying glass a try, i clipped the light to a hard cover book and put the magnifying glass into place, the field of view with the magnifying glass is small, i was unable to read an entire line of text without shifting the magnifying glass around, also the magnifying glass is circular shaped with thinner edges resulting in a fish eye effect, when it comes to reading text i found the magnifying glass pretty useless, i would much rather opt for my prescription glasses or those cheap over the counter glasses from the drug store with very limited use i then began having issues with the light, when i would lightly bump the clip area or even clip the light to a book the light would go off, in order to get it working again i would have to remove the battery cover and reseat the batteries, as i mentioned before the battery cover is tough to get off and as i do not feel like searching for a screwdriver every time this happens my thumbnail is getting all chewed up from opening the cover so what is this light good for, if you use the attached base and are reading at a desk or a similar stationary area the light is not bad at all, also if you are doing precision work at a stationary location where a magnifying glass would be useful then this would be a nice set, however i feel in each of these scenarios there are better products than this light this is one of the few times where i have to say that i feel a product i was lucky enough to review is destined for the trash, my light does not work reliably and it is too heavy and awkward to clip to a book in my opinion, i would have given the product a second star for its limited application of close up work but the reliability of this product is an issue for me, i would have to recommend passing on this product 1.0 0  BlobText  0.13168351815612103\n"

       "      <td>i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds, this was my first fender amp as well the presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how it has it is clean sound was the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max, the master volume was at and no effects were turned on i have never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts, this is not a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond it has it is clearly a defect with this product, dirty pre sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume, you d think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy hiss at low levels, wtf the next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note there has there is a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving, it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp file at a low bit rate and frequency, whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable the weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but i am not going to be stuck playing a watt amp through my pc or cans, i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted celestion speaker read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar amp related websites there has there is a page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and you shall you will find that these amps are having issues, apparently the mustang i and ii do not have these issues and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp, is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue, there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and fender does not seem to care definitely try this before you buy it, you may get an amp that does not have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds good this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage, i am disappointed that fender has not yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong but i am not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong whatever i took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the built in noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and i picked up a watt marshall instead, guess what, the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked, how about that, even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noise i shall i will knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that i had i would like to try, but before i buy another fender amp i shall i will take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds</td>\n",

       "8631  i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds, this was my first fender amp as well the presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how it has it is clean sound was the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max, the master volume was at and no effects were turned on i have never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts, this is not a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond it has it is clearly a defect with this product, dirty pre sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume, you d think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy hiss at low levels, wtf the next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note there has there is a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving, it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp file at a low bit rate and frequency, whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable the weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but i am not going to be stuck playing a watt amp through my pc or cans, i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted celestion speaker read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar amp related websites there has there is a page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and you shall you will find that these amps are having issues, apparently the mustang i and ii do not have these issues and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp, is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue, there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and fender does not seem to care definitely try this before you buy it, you may get an amp that does not have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds good this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage, i am disappointed that fender has not yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong but i am not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong whatever i took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the built in noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and i picked up a watt marshall instead, guess what, the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked, how about that, even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noise i shall i will knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that i had i would like to try, but before i buy another fender amp i shall i will take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds   \n",
