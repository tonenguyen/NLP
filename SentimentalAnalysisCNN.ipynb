       "8493   [my review s for this have changed a few times but no more, when i first got it i liked the sound though it did sound a little cold and digital and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze dreampop which by it has it is nature is full of cold tones reverb chorus delay shimmering a la cocteau twins chapterhouse lush so at first i thought it was great, then the fuse software was even cooler all this customizing the sound though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away after all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizz crackle hair it has it is called a few things, go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoo google the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things, fender guitars sound best through it which is silly if you do not own a fender and i do not and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out i wanted anything but a strat body unless i have a grand to pay for an older one i am not going to get a rinky dink one and i would only get one after i got like other dream guitars first so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality, also playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer that may be fine for some younger folks but to a lot of people i have read the complaints i was trying not to realize as i did not feel like having to pay for shipping to return it but i did and i am so glad i did, i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i did not, this amp to be fair is really close to being really cool but that sound problem which i read on fender s own forum website fender acknowledges it exists but does nothing to fix it in future models, sorry but that has that is some big company b s i have been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that and i was like what music snobs and what have you, but i realized that i am a music snob, i love the music i listen to more than anything and feel like the music i create should have a life to it as well, so i returned the mustang and almost got a marshall mg watt cause i wanted an amp with a clean sound that did not have that crackle sound but thankfully i caught myself before that return as after that it would have been final the decision i did make i think will be great for me as i had i would rather start with a good real tone then get the effects i need, i kept reading reviews of these teenagers that had not played for more than a year or two or so saying throw away your pedals you will not need them and i was going to get pedals but do not need to now that has that is kind of the danger of these amps they end up making everyone sound the same, no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang it sounded the same but in a different costume i think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and i have seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years maybe that has that is for them but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best most real tone possible so that means tube amp i think if i played this at a gc i would not of gotten it and i just tried to make myself like it]   \n",

      "45 i like this pad for the most part, i would recommend the contractor version that is sq feet vs this roll, the larger roll is wider and covers a room s floor faster, so if you have a large room to do look for the sq foot roll i did use this roll plus the larger roll together in my living room project, i could not tell a difference in thickness between the two even though various places list a mm difference, practically speaking the difference was not noticeable the sq foot roll i got was in worse shape than the contractor roll too, the plastic flap for sealing strips together had suffered storage rot, i din t bother returning it for toile reasons, i just used good duct tape to seal the seams, knox tape and cheaper duct tape would not stick to the plastic flaps your mileage may vary 0.0 1  BlobText  0.14489795918367346\n",

      "148 i wish i had written this review about a year ago soon after i purchased this tool for a much higher price because it might have caused others to stop and think more carefully about buying this boat anchor, if you do not care about accuracy do not care about the ability to drill holes repeatedly and do not care about the ability to easily drill in hardwood this is the tool for you, i had already used the kreg jig quit a bit and was pretty happy with it, its shortcomings to me were difficulty in adjusting for different wood thicknesses no on board stop for repetitive operations spacing between holes not adjustable sometimes hard and a trial and error process to change hole depth, this porter cable seemed to address the first three of these issues, generally i work with stock or sometimes x s so i do not often need to adjust for thickness, the stop on the porter cable would be nice if it did really ensure repeatable holes, holes on the right side are pretty much repeatable, but holes on the left side are not where they should be because of the flaky mechanism which has way to much slop, similarly the porter cable adjustable hole spacing would be nice if the holes actually came out where indicated by the marks on top where you set the spacing, but they do not again due to the mechanism, for what i do exact hole spacing is usually not an issue, in a recent case however i needed to keep a hole away from a slot in the edge, the slot would receive a panel when the pocket holes were joined, i could have avoided this concern by making a stopped slot, but this is a lot of work, despite carefully aligning the left hole clearly away from the slot and carefully lining up the board against the stop some holes drifted into the slot a little bit, this is non repeatabiliy due to the slop in the device, as for the ability to work with hardwoods i find it difficult to apply enough force to power the bit through using the porter cable, i do not have nearly as much trouble using the kreg, long ago i gave up using a battery powered drill to make pocket holes, i use a corded drill bigger than your standard drill so it has it is not for lack of power that drilling in hardwood is so difficult, i think that either the guide bushings or the furnished bit or both are dull, i thought i try to use one of my kreg bits to sort this out but you can not because the porter cable bit is significantly longer, i have not really used this tool that much and much of my work has been in pine which drills okay, i usually make a pine model of something before i use hardwood because there are almosts always oops that show up during the model buildup, almost always when you have to use more pressure to drill with the porter cable the hole on the left is somewhat closer deeper to the edge of the board than the right hole, this affects hole depth and perhaps screw holding ability, however i have never had a screw break through the receiving board because the hole was too deep, this is again cause by the flaky mechanism and slop, when using the porter cable you control the depth of the hole by pressing the drill bushing against a metal plate that moves with the drill until you reach the correct depth, this requires that you apply even more force when drilling force to move the drill and force to push the plate down, i work around this by simply compressing the plate fully down with my left hand while drilling with my right, when you look at how this mechanism actually works to limit the hole depth you can see how flimsy it is and why hole depths can easily vary, a significant limitation of the porter cable tool is that you can not manually adjust the hole depth, why would one want to do that anyway, here s why, sometimes i need to use a different length of screw than recommended, in a recent case the standard screw length for wood is, when i tested this screw on my project i did not get enough bite because the screw ended up in the slot i discribed above, when i simply tried a screw i got better bite but the end of the screw was uncomfortably close to breaking out of the receiving board, the goal of a perfect pocket hole is that it exit the board at the center of the board, the porter cable tool does this well, what i needed was to adjust the depth of the hole so that the exit point was a little above center so that a longer screw does not come as close to breaking out, the porter cable can not be adjusted, the kreg jig can be but it is not a simple process, one has to adjust the drilling block up toward a thinner wood setting normally it would be set for if using stock, and then you have to also adjust where the bushing is on the drill bit, so a bit of trial and error and testing but doable, a final compaint against both the kreg and porter cable drill bits is that they use only one setscrew to hold the bushing, i have already had a bushing slip, larger setscrews should also be used so that it has it is harder to strip them out, i was wowed by the potential of this tool but for me it is useless i am using the kreg for everything that i really care about, the reason that the porter cable is now so much cheaper than when i paid over for it is either that they can not sell it for that price or they are coming out with a new and improved model 1.0 0  BlobText  0.08091239416540624\n",

      "281 i bought this centering cone to use with my bosch router based on the advertised dimensions x x inches amazon s repeated recommendations which in turn were based on my purchase history and based on other bosch owners reviews which said they were using this centering cone with the same full sized router, although the product description does say it has it is for a fixed base compact router i thought i was safe based on all these other factors in particular the dimensions, as it turns out the cone is about in diameter and the pin is on one end and on the other end unfortunately the cone is too small for the base plates that come with bosch s router and the pin can not be used with a collet, the other reviewers who said they used this with their full sized bosch routers must be using aftermarket baseplates and forgot to mention it in their reviews, not a big deal i suppose because you can just use your router and chamfering bit to make your own bigger cone from wood or plastic, but it has it is still a hassle considering that it could not have cost dewalt much more to make the cone just a little bigger i was also disappointed with the amount of play with the included plastic cone, it wobbles enough that you need to wrap a few layers of scotch tape or a layer of electrical tape around the pin to actually get the base plate centered i ended up sending it back because of the size issue and imprecision, if you have a trim router or if your subbase hole is small this centering cone will probably work fine but you may have to wrap some tape around the pin 0.0 1  BlobText  -0.07336309523809524\n"
