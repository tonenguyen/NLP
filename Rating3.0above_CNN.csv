100857,"Hunter 90434 16-Inch Portable Stand Fan, Oil Rubbed BronzeThis review is about the Hunter 90434 16-Inch Portable Stand Fan, Oil Rubbed Bronze Fan. It's a very nice oscillating 3 speed adjustable height fan. You assemble it your self. When attempting to assemble the fan I found out I had a striped screw. So I contacted Hunter Fan company and they shipped me a new fan. Which assembled with no problems. I set my fan in my sliding glass windows when it cools off at night,it does a very nice job of cooling off the room.The fan comes with a 5 year warranty from Haunter.As of 7/03/1220 I'm very happy with this fan. I leave it on at night, and it's not to noisy on low  speed for sleeping (it's a 3 speed fan)The fan is efficient at what it does and that is move air weather it's stationary or it's oscillating!",5.0,1,"[0.0, 0.78, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13636363636363635, 0.0, 0.89, 0.0]",1,1

100864,"First, I showed my unit to actual house and cabinet builders and one has a RotoZip, while the other a similar tool. They both like them for small projects. They stated that their respective zip saws are fairly durable. The handle on the RotoZip can be mounted for both right and left handed people. The dust collector is great, especially if you have work inside the house. Personally, I used this tool for wood cutting: boards and trims. I find the flexibility of a hand held zip saw appealing.The only major issue I faced was when I assembled the unit. The external washer needs to be installed facing the opposite side of what seems natural - with the indentation facing the blade.

100866,"I was eager to try out this new saw.  Having never tried (or heard of) a Rotozip before, I was curious to see where I could put it to good use.Sure enough, I just had to put in a new patio door and needed to cut out some old trim, siding, and j-channels.  Man, did this thing come in handy!  First of all, you can more accurately cut with this saw than with using a Sawzall, which is what I was comparing it to.  It's pretty impressive to have such a powerful tool in one hand, allowing you to make precise cuts with ease. Of course, it can be daunting as well, as I had horrible images of accidentally sawing off a finger or too.Make sure you have the blade guard on at ALL times, even though it makes it tougher to cut. Unfortunately due to the guard, you cannot make very deep cuts with this saw (maybe 2""-3""). But you will definitely have an accurate, smooth cut, without a doubt.This saw comes with a blade for wood, a diamond blade for tile, and a fine toothed blade for ceramics and metal.  Thus far I've only used the wood blade, and it has been absolutely fantastic.  I've used it to trim branches off my Christmas tree, make small cuts in some 2""x4""s, and used it on vinyl siding, all with great results.The one thing worth mentioning - make SURE you read the directions carefully on how to put the blade in. I thought I read them correctly, but the thick washer that you use to secure the blade (with the indentation in it) goes on with the indentation facing INWARDS, towards the handle.  It does not go on the way you would think it would go, with the indentation facing outwards, allowing you to screw it down tighter.  I initially had it in backwards, and the blade was wobbly and it chewed up the plastic safety guard. The blade also spun independently of the motor. In essence - if the washer is put on incorrectly, the blade is LOOSE. The directions weren't clear AT ALL on this point - never mentioned it, and the picture they drew was almost impossible to see which way the nut was facing. This could be a potentially serious issue for this company, as I could imagine the wobbly blade flying off and gouging someone in the face.My only other gripe is that it didn't come with a case.  So I have the saw and all the blades and tools that I need for it just sitting on a bench in my garage. Would've been nice if they included a case.Besides these two hiccups, this little saw is fantastic and extremely useful! It's got plenty of power for just about anything you could use it for. This may be one of those tools that seems useful but would be something you wouldn't necessarily buy. I'm telling you - this Rotozip is VERY useful, and definitely worth the price.",5.0,1,"[0.13636363636363635, 0.22272727272727275, 0.6, 0.38333333333333336, 0.39, -0.25, -0.0625, 0.3041666666666667, 0.16666666666666666, 0.25, 0.04999999999999999, -0.15555555555555559, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07692307692307693, -0.35833333333333334, -0.15277777777777776, 0.0, 0.278125, 0.0, 0.15, 0.345]",1,1

I was able to do the little assembly required without looking at the instructions, and the very first thing we did was cut a metal pipe on our cat tree so it would fit properly to the ceiling.  In just a couple of minutes, we had it marked and cut it to fit.  A couple of days later, we had to enlarge a hole in the wall when replacing the stove exhaust fan, and this saw worked really well.  It's a hefty piece of equipment and I wasn't able to hold it when cutting about 5 1/2 up the wall, but my husband (who is both taller and stronger) could do so easily.The detachable handle is just perfect, and the little vacuum attachment for dust from the wallboard was handy, but note I have not yet used it on a large amount of wood where there is a lot of sawdust.  The cord is a good length but a little cumbersome, but because of the weight of the unit, you wouldn't want a huge rechargeable battery on this.

100879,What I like about the alarm is that it has a long (six foot) water sensor cable.  So you can wrap around a water heater instead of one place.

100881,"Water leaks can be a very serious problem that can dramatically damage property. Unfortunately, most water leaks happen in out-of-sight places, and are therefore hard to detect and manage. In such cases a good water detector can go a long way in easing your mind and helping you prevent serious water destruction.This Honeywell water alarm is well designed and works just as advertised. It's a self-contained unit that can be installed virtually anywhere. It runs on a 9V battery, just like most smoke detectors. However, unlike smoke detectors it doesn't come with a button that will let you know if the battery is dead. This may be a problem if your water detector is located in a hard to reach place.The detector can be mounted either on a mounting hook (not included) or using the self-adhesive double-sided tape (included). The problem with the latter mounting option is that if you place the detector in some inaccessible place, then you'll have a hard time replacing the battery later on. Thanks to its squareish shape, the detector can also be placed flat on any level surface, which is the setup that I have chosen to go with.The detector comes with a 4 ft. (1.2 m) leak detection cable, which is barely adequate for covering a small area. It also comes with the 6 ft. (1.8 m) leader connection that can substantially extend the detection coverage area. In fact, the leak detection cable is expandable p to 240 ft., a sufficient length that can cover a perimeter of any large room. The cables are flexible, but they are not very pliable, i.e. they won't easily conform to a shape that you would like them to be in. The cable comes with cable securing clips though, and these can be used to arrange the cable into the desirable shape. However, if you decide to change the cable's setup you will not be able to reuse these clips.I tested the alarm by spilling some water on the detection cable, and the alarm immediately went off. The alarm is fairly loud, but not as loud as the smoke detector alarm. Furthermore, unlike the smoke detectors I could not turn it off manually, but had to resort to lifting the detection cable out of the wet area.I certainly wish that this water detector had a bit better functionality, but for the basic water detection it works very well. It's a good investment for the peace of mind that it brings you.",4.0,1,"[-0.43333333333333335, 0.10416666666666666, 0.07916666666666665, 0.0, 0.5, -0.2, -0.14583333333333334, -0.09722222222222222, 0.06458333333333333, 0.0, 0.21428571428571427, -0.1, -0.21666666666666667, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.16285714285714287, 0.7]",1,1
100882,"This water sensing alarm comes with the alarm itself, a leader cable, and a four foot water-sensing cable. The leader cable plugs into the alarm box, allowing the alarm to be affixed to the wall well above the possible waterline. The water-sensing cable plugs into the leader cable and lies on the floor, ready to detect water.A few drops of water will not set off the alarm, so if you use the device to sense water in your laundry area, a drop or two of water coming off wet laundry won't give you false alarms. But if any portion of the water-sensing cable gets significantly wet, the alarm will go off. It doesn't take much, so the device will quickly alert you to any significant leak.I've had the usual spot placement alarms for my basement water heater, but if you don't pick the spot perfectly, the detector may be at a high point and not go off until considerable water is present. Having a four foot length of cable helps quite a bit. The cable can be extended using cable extensions also available from Honeywell. I tried an 8 foot extension, the RWD80, and found it worked as advertised. You can use extensions up to a  total of 240'.This package comes with some double stick tape to allow mounting of the alarm, as well as cable clips to allow you to firm down the leader and sensing cables.Instructions are sparse with one small page of operating instructions written by someone whose first language isn't English.

When I had to remove the device, the sticker lost its stick, so it wouldn't reattached without a new one (it would have been nice had they provided more than one). It's gonna be near impossible to change the battery out without having to get a new sticker every time. So, keep that in mind. There is a hole in the back of the device where you can hang it by a nail, but I'd rather not put nails in my cabinet.I then laid the sensing cable down.

The device is absolutely idiot proof. Installation is a matter of a couple of minutes and the thing works exactly as promised. The alarm is loud! It will wake you up. This is a very small investment when compared to the mess and expense we went through.

The volume of the alarm is loud and annoying enough make you wake up. The cable has a 6 ft leader cable that allows you to mount it higher up on the wall or in another room but the detecting cable itself is only 4 ft long. If you plan on using it in a laundry room or basement I would recommend getting the extensions for the leak detection cable (also available on Amazon).

100891,"Currently we use spot water detectors in various areas of our home...under our kitchen sink, near our water heater and a few areas in our basement. Compared to the spot water detectors, I absolutely love the coverage area of this water detector. This unit has 4' of water detection cable which isn't a lot, but  additional cable can be purchased to cover 240'...enough cable to potentially  cover the perimeter of an average sized basement.Off & on we've encountered water problems in our basement....at least 3 times when our water heater broke & a few other when there was exceptional flooding in our area.  This cable would've alerted us to the problems...however, it's not loud enough to be heard upstairs. Our basement steps are located in the garage...so there's no basement door that can be left open to hear any 'basement sounds.'  I've been known to put my ear to a register when I hear noises downstairs. Thankfully, we haven't had any water issues since I received this water sensor. So I put water on the cable myself, &  dried the cable to stop the alarm. However to stop the alarm in a real-life situation, it might work better to disconnect the sensor/water detector cable from the unit, and if that doesn't work, you'll have to remove the battery.Purchasing extension cable will make this unit more useful.Honeywell RWD80/T Water Defense Water Sensing Alarm Extension CableThis sensor is easy to set-up and install. Double stick tape is included to mount the alarm unit on a dry wall & there's 6' of leader connection cable (we can mount the alarm close to the basement ceiling & possibly better hear the alarm in our living area.) The 4' of leak detection/water sensor cable connects to the leader cable. C-clips are included to attach the  water sensor cable to the surface/area you want to detect.I can think of several uses for this water sensor. It can be used around clothes washers, refrigerators,  dishwashers, water heaters & of course basements. Because of the generous 6' of leader connection cable, you might be able to position the alarm where you will hear it.  In our case, it will be near our basement ceiling so we can hear the alarm upstairs.  The unit will chirp when battery life gets low.Pros:Easy to set-up & installGenerous 6' of leader connection cable included, which means you have a better chance of placing the alarm in an area you can hear it.Covers a larger area than spot detectorsCons:Not loud enoughBattery not includedIn most cases, additional sensor cable will need to be purchased.5 Star product; 1 star deducted because it's not loud enough",4.0,1,"[-0.025, 0.5, -0.015476190476190468, -0.025, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2, 0.38666666666666666, 0.14444444444444446, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.16666666666666666]",1,1
100892,"The base unit plus one cable extension permitted me to encircle my washer and dryer which are upstairs and located in a small laundry closet. Because of the tight fit, there isn't much floor visible, so a small water leak might not be immediately evident. The longer the water leaks unnoticed, the greater the damage. A water detection device in this location provides peace of mind.My initial plan was to use the water detection device in the basement near the water heater and sump pump pit, but with the basement door closed the alarm wasn't sufficiently audible to alert me. I am using standard water detecting devices in the basement and although the coverage doesn't compare to this one, I can hear the alarm when upstairs with the basement door closed.The unit installs easily - the pieces snap into place -- and requires only a 9 volt battery for power. Adhesive mounting hardware is included so the cable can be placed precisely where desired. And I like the fact that the unit can be mounted off the floor with just the cable touching water. In the event of a water leak, the base unit not sitting in a puddle should add to the life of the unit.Insurance companies can be fussy about paying for water damage - for example our homeowner's policy won't cover damage caused by the exterior sprinkler system.

100894,"I purchased this alarm 8 months ago, after two waters flooded my home within 1 year. After the current water heater was installed, I installed this alarm with the sensor on the floor around the heater. The alarm went off once. I had a very tiny leak. I was very impressed that this alarm worked with just a tiny drop of water on the floor. Great. It turned out that I needed an overflow tank, so my plumber installed that and put the alarm back in place. That was the end of Nov or early Dec. This morning at 6AM, the alarm sounded. Using paper towels, I checked the floor and wiped with paper towels (no moisture), wiped off the cable to the alarm and put in place. When I plugged the cord into the alarm, the alarm sounded and it won't stop. I called Honeywell tech support. After having me wipe the floor and cable again (paper towel was completely dry), I was asked to remove the battery and wait 2-3 minutes. The tech person told me to plug in the alarm again. The alarm sounded. I was hoping they'd send me a replacement. The only way they will replace it is if I can mail them my receipt. I bought this, along with several other items. I did not put the receipt in the file for this alarm, probably because there was a more expensive item on the same receipt. I'm a disabled senior who has had 3 foot surgeries in 3 years. Since I have not been able to go up stairs, receipts get thrown into boxes that friends have carried to my garage. I can walk now, but it's 105 degrees here and extremely humid. I cannot go into the garage to find the boxes in this weather. I DO understand WHY Honeywell wants a receipt: To prove the alarm is not more than 1 year old.  People do lie and cheat, and Honeywell has no reason to believe me when I tell them I bought the alarm 8 months ago. I get that. But I can't believe they'd lose a long-time customer over a $29 item because it MIGHT be more than one year old. I'd understand the refusal if I were asking for replacement of a $100 or more item. I have used Honeywell thermostats for 40 years. I've bought door chimes, expensive humidifiers and many other products. I was even considering a Honeywell home security/surveillance system. I'm really disappointed. Usually, companies will replace items for good will. This is a good reason why we should sign up for My Lowes; you can always get a duplicate receipt. I would have rated the alarm 5 stars if hadn't sounded a false alarm after only 8 months.

100895,"A few years ago, I set out some 'spot' water sensors in areas of concern. One of them actually warned us of a leak around our refrigerator, which saved us big bucks on repairs. I decided to try the Honeywell system and placed it around our water heater in the basement. This is also right next to our sump pump, so the sensor does double-duty. The alarm unit is small, and can be attached with the enclosed double-sided tape to a convenient spot on the water heater. A 6-foot leader extension cord plugs into the alarm unit. This is an insulated cord and will not sense dampness. The sensor cable is 4-ft long and plugs into the leader. I placed the sensor cable around the perimeter of the water heater, and affixed it with enclosed clips, which have an adhesive to stick them on the floor. It took 5 minutes to do all this. How sensitive is it? I wet my finger and touched the sensor cord, and immediately heard a 'beep-beep-beep' signal. The volume was less than our smoke alarm, but we could hear it from the main floor of the house.

100899,This Water Defense Alarm System is easy to assemble and works well.  My one concern is that the alarm could be a bit louder.  It also would have been nice to have  a button to test the alarm.I wanted this because my hot water heater is 10 years old and a plumber suggested that in case my hot water heater leaks having a monitor would give me enough warning to shut off the hot water heater before a flood occurred.This took about 10 minutes to set up in my basement.  I inserted a nine volt battery into the alarm portion of the unit.  I used a picture hook to hang it on a wall.  I attached the cable as well as an eight foot extension cable and circled it around my hot water heater.  Clips are included to anchor the cable that can be nailed into a surface or stuck onto a surface.  I chose to stick them to my wall and around my hot water heater and they worked fine.I called Honeywell to see if there was any way to test the alarm portion of the unit.  My smoke detectors have a button I press.  This unit has none so I took a few drops of water on the cable and the alarm went off.  I then dried the cable and the alarm stopped.  It would have been nice to have a test button.The alarm sounded like the sound of a battery operated smoke detector alarm. It could be heard on the main floor of my house but could not be heard on the top floor with the television playing. Once the television was shut off it could be heard.If you are on the same floor as this unit or one floor above I think you should have no problem hearing it.  If you have a really big house or a basement and two floors and you have televisions or room air conditioning units you might want to test it to see if you can hear it. Considering many people have hot water heaters in their basements I wonder if there was a way to make the alarm louder?I feel more at ease now that I have this system in place.

None of which I had any use for, or at least I thought.  I went out and purchased a couple RotoZip Metal Zipwheel Discs in order to work on the couple projects I had in mind.  We live in a older home which we rent and in between carpeted to tile areas it has those metal strips.  These things have bugged me since we moved in.  I have tried everything short of ripping them up and replacing them to smooth them out.The rotozip fixed this problem in less than 5 minutes.  I found it satisfying to really fix the problem.So I went in search of other things I could do with this thing while I was playing.  Our kitchen has these older metal cabinets with one of those old ceramic or whatever sinks, you know the kind that has the huge basin and then the counter top to its left and right are all one big piece and drain into the sink.  Well at some point someone tried to fix the doors and they must have done it with the sink off because the access to the screws they used was blocked by it.  What makes this bad is that they just kind of rigged these doors so they never actually want to stay closed.With the rotozip I was able to cut these screws in half and let them all out and then use some fasteners I had in the house for just such a thing but couldn't use them due to the screws being in the way.Chalk another problem solved by the rotozip.After that I put it away thoroughly satisfied with myself.Since that day I have used this thing on a number of projects that I never would have probably tacked had this tool not been in the house. (I am sure I have used it for things that I could have gotten by without it too. lol)I have put access holes in walls to run some speaker wire, cut a new hole in a storm door to adjust the thing that keeps it closed.  Yeah, I don't know what its called. ;)I love having this thing around the house.That being said, its not ""super"" powerful but it does get the job done.  I do try to not stress it by over revving it, but thats just me, its probably fine anyways.It does get a little warm at times too.I didn't use the dust management system.

100915,"If you're a contractor--plumber, electrician, heating--this tool is an excellent alternative to a reciprocating saw. When you're working with existing construction, you're often faced with cutting sheetrock in a way that's repairable.  This little saw allows freehand cuts with an tolerance of +- 1/16"" or so (with practice), and the included circle cutter is more than large enough to make room for ducts of most any size.  The Rotozip has two advantages over a reciprocating saw in this application:  1) The depth of cut is very controllable, so there's less chance of damaging hidden pipes or wiring. 2)The dust-collection system works well, connecting nicely to my shop vac's hose.  Very little mess escaped in my testing.While only two bits are included in the kit (sheetrock and general-purpose), many more are available for applications such as tile and flooring.  I did not have an opportunity to test in these applications.  There are also cutoff wheels available.  The motor feels substantial enough to do this sort of work, but perhaps not full-time.  I was interested in how well this would work with wood.  I started by making a freehand drawing on a piece of 1/8"" hardboard (similar to masonite).  This cut very nicely and will be good to have around for some sorts of interior cuts.  I then moved to 3/8"" interior plywood, but it was a different story.  I was not forcing the cut--just letting the saw take its time--but had only gotten a couple of inches into the cut when the bit snapped.  The cut itself was quite splintered--much messier than with a saber saw or jigsaw.  While the depth guage appears to support cuts as deep as 3/4"", I'm not at all sure how it would do.  Even though a jigsaw handle is available, I'd need a lot more persuading to use this as a woodworking tool.While you're not going to mistake this for a Milwaukee or Makita, build quality feels OK. . It comes in a nice little canvas case, with a zipper mouth that stays open for easy access. The depth gauge is plastic, which would allow an irregular cut when forced. None of this matters with sheetrock, which is perhaps the best place for this saw to stay",4.0,1,"[1.0, -0.6, 0.20535714285714288, -0.04444444444444443, 0.6, 0.12890625, 0.0, 0.4, -0.0875, 0.25, 0.0, 0.74, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.4666666666666666, 0.21145833333333333, -0.30000000000000004, 1.0]",1,1

I shot three 3/4 pins to connect to pieces of cherry of about 1/2 inch thick. I couldn't pull them apart without prying them apart with the screwdriver (of course, two pieces of pine would not hold the pins so securely but one could use longer pins with heads (partially braided) and shoot them at an angle to compensate for the softness of the wood, I guess).Usually, you can find something you don't like or not so crazy about in a particular tool.

100931,"This pin nailer is both easy and comfortable to work with.  It is very light and appears to be constructed solidly.  It is also easy to load and unload.  In fact, I don't know how it could be any easier.So far I have used this to drive pins into oak and maple, including pre-finished oak and maple.  Pins up to 1-3/8 inch sink just below flush every time.  When I first started using it, I had some difficulty getting pins to sink all the way.  I discovered that you really have to press firmly and squarely against the work because there is a slight bit of recoil that will prevent the pin from sinking completely otherwise.  Until I discovered that the problem was recoil, I kept turning the pressure up thinking that would sink the pins deeper.  That, apparently, was the wrong thing to do.  I have since found that reducing the pressure reduces the recoil and makes it easier to sink the pins.  So far, I have had very good results using 80psi for all pin sizes. Though even lower pressures may work well for shorter pins, I haven't found the need to experiment further.This is a very nice nailer.  The magazine is long enough (130 pin capacity) to allow reloading BEFORE running dry; that's a big convenience over the Grex.  It has a dry fire lockout mechanism that, from my perspective, is essential for these pinners.  Without dry fire lockout, you could nail all day on ""empty"" and never notice.Contrary to the specifications, this nailer seems to work fine with 1/2 inch pins.  So far I have used both Grex and Porter-Cable 1/2 inch pins with no misfires.  I contacted Porter-Cable and asked why they don't rate it for 1/2 inch pins and was told that they simply had not tested them. The rep told me that if 1/2 inch pins work ok, there is no problem using them.I also asked about using oil.  The rep told me that the nailer is designed to work without oil, but that using oil will not harm anything.  He said that some people like to use oil anyway; there is nothing wrong with that.Finally, the thing comes in a very nice, compact, molded case with separate indents for the nailer, a box of pins (1 inch pins included), and a comfortable pair of safety glasses (included), so nothing rattles around.

It is a copy of it larger brother the 618, which I've owned for several years and is my primary go-to router. This little guy is quickly becoming its replacement. It smaller and lighter than its brother making it easier to handle. But keeps all the great features. Here is my quick summary:The Good:-depth of cut is easily set and modified, with great precision.-The plunge base is great for mortising, dadoes, and grooves. Something other trim routers just don't support.-Size and operation is great. Light weight, but has enough power for most router jobs.-LED really lights up the work. LEDs are finding their way into more and more tools. And they are great.The not so good:-The detachable cord is hard to find the index. You have to plug the detachable cord into the top of the router but it only goes in one way and has to be perfectly lined up to insert. I like that it's detachable but could be easier (although it's improved over the 618).-Only 1/4"" collet. I know it's a trim router and 1/2 bits are supposedly too much for this size. But frankly I think it could handle many of my bits (straights, roundovers, etc).-I'm still on the fence about the soft carrying case. It allows the tools to clank around up against each other as you transport.

Much handier than a full sized router.  I purchased a Bosch Colt compact router kit a couple of years back for small laminate trimming jobs & lettering & always wanted a plunge base.  But a plunge base wasn't available for the Colt at that time.  So I purchased the Dewalt & have been more than pleased.  In fact... The Dewalt Compact Router kit with fixed AND plunge bases doesn't cost all that much more than just the new base alone for the Bosch Colt.

100953,"I own a Rigid trim router previously. It was a wonderful little thing, which I used for flushing trimming and carving signs. It was much lighter in weight, but still sturdily built, made it very manuverable and versitile. But the lack of a plunge base and imcompatiblity with most accessories rendered it much less useful than it could be.So when I decided to upgrade, I considered several factors: available accessories, dust collection, visibility, and weight/size. I researched the internet and went to the local stores many times to compare. Looked at Bosch Colt, Makita, and this Dewalt kit. It boils down to really two choices, the Makita kit and the Dewalt. I liked the Makita becasue for a little over 200 bucks you'll get 4 bases, edge guide, and 1/4 and 3/8 collets. The Dewalt kit cost a little less, but is sure comes with a lot less accessories. Nevertheless I eventually decided on this one for the following reasons:1. Although it doesn't come with edge guides, the plunge base is 100% compatible with my existing porter cable accessories: edge guide and guide bushings.2. Its sub-base is transparent.3. It has two LED lights. This is important for a trim router because most of the work I do using a trim router need to trace a pattern free hand without any guide or template. So visibility is key. Without a clear sub-base and lights, the Makita would make things a lot more difficult.4. Its depth adjustment on the fixed base is lot better than the Makita. It's quick realease allow you to change bits very conveniently. And the twist adjustment is more controllable than the makita. The makita design falls behind on this one. Once you loose the latch, the motor will just drop to the bottom. The rack and pinion is too loose to retain any force. Kinda defeats the purpose of its fine adjustment ability.5. Dust colletion althought not included, but can be added for about $11 more.After using it, here is what I like about it:1. Soft start motor, and relatively quiet.2. Good balance with both the fix base and the plunge base.3. Those LED lights are great. They really light up the work surface well. They might not matter on a large router where there are large openings to allow you to see. But on a compact router this is a must.4. Plunge action is precise and smooth. And honestly, its motor is more powerful to handle most of the tasks than your hands can. In other words, for free hand plunge routing, your hand will likely to be the limiting factor and not its motor.Now what I wish Dewalt can do better:1. The motor and its base are kinda ""fat"". They are not as comfortable to hold than any of other popular brands. (Ridgid, Makita, Bosch). This router feels more like a full size router than a trimmer.2. Doesn't come with a 3/8"" collet like the Makita. I would really like that because 3/8"" spiral bits, which is the most common mortising size, comes either in 3/8"" shank or 1/2"" shank. Not having the collet for that means I can not easily use this router for any mortising tasks bigger than 1/4"", which is a shame given that the motor is so powerful and the plunge base can dip a full 2 inch.3. And lastly, probably the worst design flaw on this router is its collet design. It doesn't allow you to use two wrenches. You have to press the detent pin and turn the nut with only one wrench. This is particularly a problem when you need to remove a bit. With two wrenches, you can set the two wrenches slightly apart, and just squeeze on them with your hands. With a detent pin and only one ranch, your arm will have to exert so much force that you will find yourself slamming your knucles into the work bench a lot more than you or your wife would like.",4.0,1,"[0.21666666666666667, 0.40625, 0.2, 0.03888888888888889, 0.25, 0.0, 0.022222222222222213, 0.20625, -0.005208333333333322, -0.4, -0.8, 0.0, 0.43333333333333335, 0.0, -0.17500000000000002, -0.0666666666666667, 0.26666666666666666, 0.5, -0.4, -0.07692307692307693, -0.07692307692307693, 0.4166666666666667, 0.19999999999999998, -0.30000000000000004, 0.8, 0.4, 0.21428571428571427, 0.0, 0.3, 0.47500000000000003, -0.0050000000000000044, 0.2916666666666667, 0.0, 0.425, 0.0, 0.13333333333333333, -0.07333333333333336, -0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.16666666666666666, -0.16666666666666666, 0.2333333333333333]",1,1

100960,"This was my first router, and it's well made and seems robust, but has some disadvantages to be aware of:1. There are some accessories you may find essential. You may need an edge guide, and I would recommend the DW1963 (which fits the plunge base) over the rather basic DNP618 that fits the fixed base. The fixed base comes with D sub-base, which is essential for such a small router, but you will need the DNP613 round base and DNP617 centering cone to use templet (template) guides.2. The spindle lock allowing one-wrench bit changing sounds great but in use it is difficult to get a firm enough grip on the motor to tighten the collet sufficiently and even being aware of this I've had bits come loose a few times.  There seems no way to tighten the collet the conventional way with two wrenches.3. A 1/4&#34; collet is very limiting in bit choice, as well as contributing to the loosening problem mentioned above. I would suggest that a beginner like me would be better served starting with a somewhat larger motor with a 1/2&#34; collet (I bought one only a few weeks later! - not really a waste because having two routers is a boon for some jobs).4. The variable speed is really unnecessary for a router this size - any bit that is appropriate to use in a 1/4&#34; collet can be run at full speed.  Unfortunately, moving up to the next size with 1/2&#34;collet routers seem to have reliability issues in the lower price range, so my second router is the basic fixed speed DeWalt 1-3/4 hp router where variable speed would actually be useful!So overall this is a very good router package, but may be not what you really want as a first router for a beginner.",3.0,1,"[0.16666666666666666, -0.375, -0.34375, 0.010439560439560442, -0.14285714285714285, 0.1, 0.049999999999999996, 0.13749999999999998, 0.12599999999999997]",0,1

Needless to say, there was very little to choose from. An infomercial from a popular pocket-hole joinery item made out of blue plastic came on and I was intrigued. My spouse is pretty handy but I'm not. The infomercial made it look like something I could handle. However, I rarely - if ever - order anything from television and tend to distrust TV products in general.Once finally up and about, I started a bit of research on pocket hole jigs and found some pro's and con's. Like normal, I came here to Amazon to compare prices against those advertised on the infomercial (Amazon beat it!) and then, right before ordering the blue plastic one..ran across this one.The price difference was pretty substantial but after reading the reviews, comparing the weight of both products (big difference!) and then taking the time to find the Porter Cable videos of this little thing in action...well, I was sold! I quickly put in the order and (of course) watched the price instantly drop by at least $30 by the time it arrived three days later.

Well recently I was looking through a wood working magazine and saw that Kreg has come out with the new K5 jig system and I liked the looks of it so I decided to look it up on the internet and read some user reviews. Upon doing that I came across the Porter Cable Quickjig pocket hole jig. I didn't even know that Porter Cable made a pocket hole jig but I was sure impressed with the looks of it.

I just finished some cedar patio furniture that had tons of pocket holes and every single hole was clean, the correct depth, straight and repeatable. All in all, it does what it is supposed to, and does it well. Do not try to use a cordless drill with this, none of mine had the speed or power to tackle pocket holes. Maybe some of the expensive ones will work, but only my corded drills had the needed power.That said, there are some things that are less than stellar:1. The dust collection cup is wonderful to have and my wet/dry vac with 1.25&#34; hose fits perfectly, however, it does not catch all the shavings as there is a gap in front of the cup when it is fully inserted that allows some shavings to not get picked up.2. if you do not attach a vac to the dist collection hole, make sure you empty the cup regularly; if you do not, the shavings can pile up to the point that they will interfere with drilling all the way.3. While the adjustable stop is wonderful, it'd be nice to have some way to lock it in place at specific distances, such as placing the pocket hole at 1/4&#34;, 1/2&#34;, etc. away from the edge of the board. I can attain this just fine by making a couple boards with holes at the appropriate places and then adjusting the stop to match, but it'd be cool if you could have both ways of doing things.all in all, I love this thing and if it ever broke (not likely, but I do see a couple potential problem spots if a gorilla was being too rough) I would happily replace it.

Just a wrench, screwdriver and some plumbers tape. It has a wonderful high arc (depending on high deep your sink is) which makes filling filling high tall pots great. Since the sprayer pulls straight down, you hit your target instead of water spraying everywhere. Another great feature is that you down let the hose dangle unlike conventional sprayer which can get ""kinked"" from the weight of the sprayer head.This faucet does not have a base but they are available separately. Our previous set up we had a sprayer, faucet, temperature control handle and soap dispenser. We purchased stainless steel hole covers to cover two of the holes that were no longer needed since we still are going to use the soap dispenser.The faucet is beautiful and easy to use.

It has never been difficult for me to do simple faucet fixes and leaks around the house; even larger water problems have not been too hard to solve.  And it has always been a bit of fun.

101023,"First, I hate it when reviewers say things like ""... and it's orange.."" when it's very clear that the product is orange - tell us something we can't tell easily ourselves, something that adds value. But I'm about to do that very thing.Also, I'm going to compare it to a Kohler faucet (amazon product number B000MF882K, and looking at the picture of it may make what I say below more obvious) that I've had for a couple of years. This isn't going to be a con/pro review (because it's a nice faucet and I don't see any cons so much as I see ""are you sure this is what you want issues""). So...1) This is an expensive faucet and while I haven't had it long enough to judge how it will hold up, it seems well made and the price suggests it should be. The finish is a nice lightly brushed stainless.2) I was used to the Kohler and I liked it. It's a similar idea: single handle control , and the head of the faucet pulls out to be used as a sprayer-on-a-hose. But a couple of differences that I notice (in two near-identical sinks): On this faucet, only the bigger head at the end pulls out and while that works OK, it seems more awkward to pull it toward me than on the Kohler, because it pulls downward, whereas on the Kohler the part that pulls out is the head and several inches of the neck, and it pulls out more horizontally (with openings stil pointing down), which provides a nice handle, and you are pulled the hose sort of straight out.2) Make sure that you don't have cabinets over the sink that are low enough that this might seem too tall. This isn't at all a criticism, and for most people it won't make a difference, but measure if you do.3) This is a slight criticism, though I'm not sure it's fair as the issue is clearly visible: The control knob being on the side (which is typical with these high, arching faucuts) means only using the right hand, and I've got friends that have faucets which this feature. I'm not wild about it, but what I notice with this model is that the handle seems smaller than others and I find it hard to adjust easily. To be fair, I'm a very tall guy with large hands.4) These type of faucets (with the sprayer built indo the machin faucet) tend to reduce the water pressure because the swivel capability of the head means that it uses an attachment with a small flow-through swivel area (I haven no idea what the correct terms are). However, this one seems to be less affected by that than the Kohler, which is nice.All in all, I like this faucet. I hope it's well made and at roughly $350 as I type this, it should be.

101027,"Actually, I installed it in my laundry room, and not my kitchen.  In the kitchen I have a grohe LadyLux faucet and I think this faucet is on par with that faucet. It is much nicer installed than this picture shows.  When you view it from above, when it's installed, the handle doesn't look so disjointed from the body of the faucet (see pictures).  The sprayer hose is about three feet long and it works great when I need to fill a pan or bucket next to the sink when the sink is full of soaking items.  Water flows nicely from the aerated head and the flow is as strong or stronger than my grohe faucet.  You can alternate from flow to spray by pressing the black toggle button on the head.  When you set it to one or the other it stays put with that style of spray.  I can't always get my grohe to toggle onto the thin stream mode.The arctic stainless finish is beautiful and doesn't show spots like a chrome faucet would.  I cannot yet speak to the longevity of the tubes, washers, and valves inside, but I can say that it is easy to install.  Yes, I've installed faucets before, but this one wasn't challenging at all.

101042,"I rec'd the BR for Christmas from my wife. Based on the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure whether I'd like it or not. Finally got time to open it up today and try it out. There's some really good reviews already, here's my 2 cents:1. I didn't find the blades or allen wrench. I thought they were missed at the factory or I'd rec'd a repackaged unit. I kept looking. After looking longer than I'd care to admit, I finally saw the little bin at the top with the picture of the white blade on it. Can we all say ""Eye Exam""?  The bin on the bottom is a dust collection bin. So, if you buy this, look for the blades/wrench in the little bin at the top right under the cutting table. I then dropped the little blade bin on the floor and it landed face down. However, the blades stayed pretty much in the holder due to the way one end of each blade holder rests over the top of the blade (You'd have to see it to understand what I'm talking about). I was surprised that I didn't have blades all over the floor. Way to go, Rockwell.2. The guide arm was easy to install. Two allen screws and it was installed.3. Before starting it up, I inserted a Bosch blade I had into the holder and looked at the alignment on the guide rollers. It was bending the blade a mite, so I performed the adjustment on the back of the arm. The guide rollers never touched both sides of the blade, so I had the left roller touch the left side of the blade and made sure the blade was straight. I was concerned that I might still have some wobble-flop going on when I fired it up, but proceeded on. BTW, inserting the blade is a total dream it's so easy. Make sure you push it in all the way before releasing the lock tab, though.4. I set the speed to max, inserted the hose for the shop vac and started up the unit. I made the following cuts:----- 1/8"" piece of fiberboard in a circle scroll--cut great (of course, it's f/b)----- 2x6 cedar cross-cut --- cut great. Not fast, but true.----- 2x6 cedar scroll cut. I made a little toy car.-- Worked great.----- 1/2"" plywood scolling and made the letter ""M""--cut great (didn't expect this)----- 1/2"" plywood straight cut ---cut straight, no issues (again, didn't expect it)----- 1/2"" plywood straight cut using the Rockwell ""speed bore"" blade, cut fine. Haven't tried the other Rockwell blades.5. The shop vac pulled just about all the dust. I was surprised that the % of dust left on the table was so minimal. The port's angled and set in a good place. I would recommend getting a cheap shop brush and vacuuming/brushing under the red plate where the saw blade inserts after use. Dust collects there and would probably gum up the works over a period of time if not cleaned.Overall, the little saw really performed. It's really light, so I thought it might be cheesy, but it's pretty sturdy. I haven't set up the mount on the wall yet.If you buy one, a few things to keep in mind:-- Don't rush the cut. Pushing too fast will make the wood rock and jump. Smooth and easy.-- Keeping the guide arm down is essential for safety. It helps steady the wood somewhat as well.-- Put a little pressure on the wood to hold it down while cutting. Keep in mind it's a jig-saw blade you're working with.-- Watch your fingers, blades are unforgiving (okay, I just heard you all say ""ya think?"", but safety is always worth stating and re-stating).I probably wouldn't use it for gen'l cross cuts on 2x4's etc for large home remodeling projects as it's a jig-saw blade, but for wood working projects, one-off 2x4 cross-cuts, small pieces, and gen'l shop use, this saw seems to be a very good addition.

101046,"The machine arrived today in good condition.The only real ""assembly"" is connecting the guide arm. They provide the two machine bolts and the correct allen wrench, so that took about two minutes. The assembly directions are printed on a single piece of paper with clear pictures; One side in English, the other in Spanish. It is very easy!After inspecting the blades they provided, I immediately threw them out. I installed high quality bosch blades, which in my experience always provide good results. The idea is simple: use blades that I KNOW work well to remove one variable. That way, I would truly be testing the machine, not the blades.Here's the good part first:It cuts very nicely! The first test cuts were ripping thin strips of spruce and aspen. I cut 24-inch strips using the included rip fence and am delighted to report they came out smooth and consistent. The greatest variance in dimension was about four-thousandths of an inch over the length of 24 inches. That's close enough for my needs.Then I thought to test this in some difficult material: Plywood. If you have any experience cutting plywood with other tools, you already know how it is prone to chipping and tear-out. With the Bosch ""clean-for-wood"" blade installed, this cut a perfect edge through 3/4"" veneered plywood! (that's more a testimony to Bosch blades than this saw though)I have a small shop vac that exactly fits the included dust port. When I hooked it up, I discovered the vacuum actually does remove most ( but not all) of the dust. That's OK with me since a quick puff of air gets rid of the remaining dust between cuts.The tool-free quick-change blade mechanism works easily, just like in the videos.BTW: All the videos you see of this thing on YouTube are copied from an included DVD. The DVD has ""chapters"" for set-up, best results and other tips. Rockwell was smart and hired a real carpenter to do the presentation. Although he looks like a male-model, he obviously is no new-comer to handling tools. If there are any lascivious lady-crafters out there reading this, I think you might find the guy very easy on the eyes! If you are unfamiliar with jig-saws, the video reference will be a good resource before you start.So I am quite happy with the cut quality when using a SLOW FEED-RATE and HIGH-QUALITY BOSCH BLADES.My main need was for cutting long-thin strips of wood cleanly and safely. This tool does that very well.Now for the not-so-good...>>>All the advertisements, including the videos, claim this has a ""stainless steel"" top. It has an aluminum top. In my case, that is a disappointment because I had some magnetic jigs and hold-downs I wanted to use with this thing. The aluminum top is only ""stainless"" in the sense that aluminum doesn't rust. Magnets will NOT stick to aluminum, so no magnetic hold downs or feather boards will work. I'll have to rig up some other contrivance for my ripping operations. That is a nuisance, but not a deal breaker. I just want others to be aware that the top is non-magnetic.&lt;&lt;&lt;[[[[[PLEASE NOTICE: I was just informed by another Amazon reader that I may be wrong about the material in the top. It is possible that the top is made from a special type of Stainless steel called ""Austenitic,"" and therefore non-magnetic. The reason I was disappointed was because I could not use magnetic jigs with this tool. That is still true, regardless of what material the top is made of. I will leave the erroneous paragraph, just so some readers will understand the comments. ]]]]]As I and other reviewers have noted, the included blades are junk. Don't use them. Get Bosch blades instead.You must feed the material SLOWLY. This saw has no orbital action. The blade moves only straight up-and-down. That's great for smooth cuts, but it slows down cutting speed dramatically. If you intend to cut through hard materials or thick woods, do not expect fast cutting. You will have to be patient and go slowly to get smooth cuts.The included side bearings do not engage the blade during straight cuts, so you are totally dependent on your technique and slow feed-rate to make a good cut. There is no adjustment for side-to-side clearance of the upper guide-bearings, so if that is important to you you will have to figure out a different method of guiding the top of the blades.I have not tried these ideas yet but here are a few solutions I thought of today while testing the machine:One, just get larger bearings and install them in place of the small bearings it comes with.Two, Modify the bearing-block to accept ""cool blocks"" like those found on some high-end European bandsaws.(Morse, the band-saw blade company, sells inexpensive cool blocks for small bandsaws like Ryobi.)Three, dispense with the guides altogether and cut one from UHMW plastic.Now, obviously, NONE OF THOSE IDEAS are for beginners and ALL of them pose some dangers. Use them at your own risk!I suppose modifying the machine would also void the warranty; which is a two year limited warranty BTW.If you intend to make curved cuts, then the guide blocks should be loose. Curved cuts require the blade can twist slightly in the cut. As it comes from the factory, these guides will allow for plenty of twist! They have over 0.010"" (ten-thousandths) of ""play"" or ""freedom of movement"" from side-to-side.One last small complaint: the cord is short, about three-feet. So IF you were actually going to mount it to a wall, then you'd need to mount it near an outlet. The package I received showed signs that this tool was returned and repackaged. Although they did a decent job of disguising the repackaging, the wall mount was missing. That's a bummer since I had a place in the basement all ready to accept this mounting. It isn't worth returning just to get a wall mount which I can build in ten minutes for almost nothing.So, I will keep this machine because it fulfills a particular need I have. It cuts well so long as you use good blades and feed slowly. Dust collection helps. The Miter gauge is what you'd expect in this level of tool; not accurate or sturdy.I can't complain too much about the sloppy guide-bearings since this is a hobbyist's tool. The engineers had to make some allowances for its many potential uses and the profit margin at this price point.I am disappointed that the top is NOT MAGNETIC as I thought it should be if made of steel, but I can live with that.I valued this machine by considering what it costs for a decent jigsaw, plus the materials and time it would take for me to build something better. Overall, I think Rockwell has hit the right price point at one-twenty-five. Any more than that and the value diminishes quickly. Although I have built several jigs that hold jig-saws upside down, I have not built one with dust-collection, an over-head support arm and a tool-free blade change on top of the table.For me to build something that complex with those features would take more of my valuable time than the price of this machine is worth. As I said, I have built several such contraptions. They all work, but not substantially better than this, and that is in spite of the fact that I use really good jig-saws by Bosch and Festool. So for me, this is a good deal.Bottom line: If you know what you want and know about jigsaws already, this is a handy little gizmo with good features.It is not a superb tool or accurate enough for fine joinery, but it does several things very well with the right blades, good technique and patient steady hands.If you are not familiar with jig-saws, this is a good choice since it is probably one of the safest set-ups for jig-sawing imaginable. The included DVD will inform you about how to operate it safely. Therefore it would be really great for hobbyists and homeowners, which is exactly the target market Rockwell aims for.I hope that helps you make an informed decision.",4.0,1,"[0.3, 0.0, -0.01928571428571428, 0.5633333333333334, 0.43, 0.0, 0.5766666666666667, -0.07500000000000001, 0.45, 1.0, -0.25, -0.3625, 0.6833333333333333, 0.16666666666666666, 0.1638888888888889, 0.4, 0.4375, 0.20714285714285713, -0.03409090909090909, 0.5633333333333334, 0.13433333333333333, 0.39999999999999997, 0.5, -0.6, 0.2333333333333333, 0.0, -0.125, 0.0, 0.1875, 0.2642857142857143, -0.75, 0.425, -0.5, -0.125, 0.0, -0.30000000000000004, 0.1, 0.014814814814814808, 0.11111111111111113, -0.24791666666666667, 0.11666666666666665, 0.096, 0.04999999999999999, 0.0, 0.15054945054945054, -0.16666666666666666, 0.0, -0.11000000000000001, 0.05, 0.0, -0.016666666666666677, 0.2, 0.005555555555555554, 0.11666666666666663, 0.0, -0.13888888888888892, 0.15043290043290042, 0.14285714285714285, 0.41666666666666663, 0.17777777777777778, 0.0, 0.6, 0.26626984126984127, 0.5, 0.525]",1,1

I use Bosch and buy the sets that have a variety of blades to cut all kinds of material. I build small projects like boxes and clocks with many different species of wood and so far the BladeRunner has served me well with straight and irregular cuts where needed. With the right kind of blade it will cut a circle about 2 inches in diameter if needed. Soon after I got it I tried cutting a 1/4 inch thick piece of Nickle Silver for a knife making project and while it was a slow process it did cut it right on the money. The reason it was a slow process was because I had to guide the Nickle Silver by hand and it got to hot to hold and I had to stop every so often, but while cutting it did it very well.The ONLY complaint I have is the arm location limits the size of the material that can be cut, but it isn't all that often I encounter that problem so it's a minor inconvenience.

101063,"I bought the BladeRunner before it was on Amazon.com. What I saw in the video presentation was a jig saw, not a scroll saw or table saw. It functions exactly as I expected, with those limitations reviewers have mentioned. I've been woodworking for almost 60 years, and have a workshop with big cast-iron table saw, compound miter saw, 14"" band saw, 6"" jointer/planer, 12"" drill press, 16"" scroll saw and shaper, to mention most. (Many are over 20 years old, and are made with cast iron and steel.) I would not give up my BladeRunner.Years ago, before I could afford dedicated shop tools, I had a jig saw, with table, which were quite useful, but the BladeRunner is hands down more versatile. I adjusted the wall mount for my working height, and lagged it to studs in my garage. It's handy and ready to go. Even though it can be removed for use from the wall to the job site, I would not recommend this tool freestanding on a bench without at least clamps holding it down.It performs jobs quickly, which would be a bother to set up on the big stationary tools. I no sooner got it mounted, than I needed to make a few cuts in 1"" stock, which were executed on my BladeRunner, easily and quickly.Now, for those of you who expect to use this as a substitute for a radial saw, table saw, band saw or scroll saw, this is not the tool for you. For me, the most important tools are a table saw and a drill press. The BladeRunner has many limitations as the reviewers have mentioned, BUT, as an added, stable, wall mounted powertool, in my opinion, it is a must in a workshop.

101069,"Rockwell should make it apparent that this is a table saber saw, NOT a jig/scroll saw. Calling it a ""BladeRunner"" is as clear as calling it a ""PudBlump"". Rockwell should state what type of blade shank is compatible. It needs to be the kind that has 2 crescent shaped indentations and 2 tabs above the indentations on the shank. However, there is a stenciled shape of the blade on the unmentioned tool drawer located just underneath the table top in the front.This is the only table saber saw that I've ever located. There used to be tables that would mount hand-held routers or saber saws, but they seem to be no longer sold. I was looking for an inexpensive substitute for a small band saw for making only straight cuts, but all the table scroll saws I found did not have square tables, and so, they can't have fences or even the ability to mount a temporary fence/jig for (trying to) making straight cuts.It comes with a miter gauge attachment that's definitely cheap. There are three 2-holed shim strips supplied for the gauge. I had to ""tin snip"" one to produce a ""washer"" shim which is on the angle adjustment knob. Using a whole shim results in an unacceptable gap between the fence and the table top. Even so, the gauge's fence also doesn't lie perfectly flat on the table, probably because the table top being made of sheet metal rather than being a machined-flat slab of cast metal ($$$). This makes the table surface uneven and creates gaps under the miter gauge's fence.My main reason for getting this tool is to cut 0.62 inch hard plastic (epoxy resin+fiber glass) printed circuit boards for circuit prototyping purposes. Thin stock can unintentionally slip underneath the fence which causes a miss-cut. This doesn't happen on materials thicker than about 1/10th inch. I would gladly purchase a better miter gauge, but the table's gauge slot is proprietary and won't hold a standard gauge. Why did Rockwell do this ?!I solved the problem of thin stock slipping under the miter gauge by fabricating a one-inch-on-both-sides right angle piece of sheet metal that sits between the upright of the gauge's ""protractor"" and the fence bar. It's about 6 inches long. See the ""user's images"".Overall, the unit is easy to use, is reasonably quiet, has reasonably little vibration and generally works well. The supplied blades are very poor quality. I am using Bosch T118A 24-tpi blades purchased at Lowes which were the only brand available, but work well. Most of the other brand blades sold had the other shank type which do not fit this unit. Strangely, my local Home Depot carries no blades with the right shank type.I have no intention of using the wall mount bracket at this time. I would sooner build a custom shelf/table, especially since the unit's feet are rubber and should grip a wooden surface well. The supplied wall mount seems convenient, but holds the unit with only 2 small plastic hooks that attach to the table top's lip. The bottom of the unit is free to swing out when pulled, though I guess this would never be a problem. While the wall brackets looks strong, the table attachment method to the bracket is very hokey. I would rather Rockwell excluded the wall brackets (or made them optional) and instead had a flatter table top and standard miter gauge slots. I would gladly pay more money for these two features.

101174,"The install of the ""Honeywell Econoswitch RPLS740B 7-Day Solar Time Table Programmable Switch"" took me about 30 minutes - but only because the switch box I went into had a 3-way switch next to the 2-way switch I was replacing.  This made for a little more work determining the neutral wire - as the switch I swapped out did not have a white wire connected.  Once I sorted that out, I had no problems.  (The white neutral wires were tied together in the back of the box.)  The Honeywell switch is pretty large, but it fit in my double gang (two switch) box just fine.I am running two 13 watt fluorescent bulbs with no problems.  The packaging for the switch says there is no minimum wattage - and fluorescent bulbs are OK.  Interesting, the max wattage is a little lower for incandescent or halogen light bulbs (1440 watts vs. 1800 watts) - but the max is still plenty high for a lighting circuit.  The switch can also be used for pool pump motors.  Programming was pretty easy.  I looked on the internet for the latitude and longitude of my city.  Later, I found that the instructions also have a listing for most major cities in the US and Canada.  I set the switch to go on from sunset to sunrise.  I set it the same for every day of the week, but the programming allows different settings for different days.  Since the switch is going off a theoretical calendar, the light goes on a few minutes before absolutely necessary.  (The specifications say the sunrise/sunset table used by the program is accurate to within 11 minutes.)  Fortunately, the switch stays off during the day - much better than the Zenith radio signal motion sensor switch it replaced.  Even photocell switches sometimes stay on during the day when they shouldn't.Family members had no trouble walking up to the switch and figuring out how to turn the outdoor lights off or on, if they wanted to.  It is pretty intuitive.  For the most part, there is no reason to ever touch it after you program it.  The instructions indicate the time must be reset after a power outage of 4 hours or longer.

101186,"PROS====This switch does exactly what I wanted: it's the indoor switch for all the outside lights, turns them on 1/2 hour after sunset (I used its programming to override ""on at sunset"") and turns them off a bit after midnight (overrode its default of ""off at 11PM"").  It's built-in calendar adjusts the ""on"" setting each evening, and if it had been set to stay on all night, would adjust the ""off"" setting each morning.The alternative was to install photocells on each outdoor light, or to replace all of the outdoor fixtures with ones that had their own built-in photocells.  Either alternative would have cost more, and, like other people, my experiences with on/off photocells has been less than satisfactory.Originally, the outdoor fixtures contained CFL's (60-watt equivalent), which worked fine with the switch, but a month ago, I replaced them with LED's (40-watt equivalent).  Those work fine, too, and, to my surprise, are quite a bit brighter than the CFL's.Hopefully, this means we won't have to think about the outdoor lighting for at least 10 years, maybe even the 22.8 that the bulbs claim.Instead of battery-backup, the switch relies on a capacitor (or super-capacitor) that never wears out, never needs replacement. This is very nice, but has a real limitation (see below).The switch is silent (no buzzing) except when it turns on/off: the mechanical relay is quite audible, just for the instant it opens or closes.CONS====Programming the switch is a bit complicated, mostly because the instructions are too brief (Honeywell minimized its use of paper), but after a couple of tries, it's doing what it should.The backup capacitor only provides 4 hours of backup during a power outage: if the power's out longer than that, you have to re-enter the settings, and I don't know if that means having to entirely reprogram it.OTHER=====The switch has a small illuminated display with three ""brightness"" settings: off, low, high.  When you press a button, it goes to ""high"" for a while, then falls back to whatever you chose as the permanent setting (""low"" for our switch).

101193,Others have detailed the programming issues as well as the install . I have had the product for several months and through two daylight savings time switches as well as one long power outage of 16 hours . Sadly the switch had to be programed as the internals did not save programing for the 16 hour event and it stopped working . However all the values were retained it was just a matter of remembering how to initialize it and complete the programing . I went through 3 reps in customer service before I found one that could help me through the necessary steps as I myself forgot what I did the first time and the directions are useless .This timer has followed very well the change in seasons and turned the light on and off appropriately . I am very pleased . The lamp I use this on is a security lamp on the east side of a building hidden from the sun so a daylight switch does not work well at all . This works great other then the need for programming if the power goes out for more then a few hours . I have been a snowbird in the past and that would be a deal breaker but not so much now so I live with it . Otherwise very pleased and I would think they could fix this and make it a perfect switch . It is already one of the best .Note still going strong power went out again for 7 hours 7 14 13 and it lost the time and programing on off function other values again were retained . Called Honeywell customer service because I never can remember how to program it . They were wonderful make sure to choose thermostat then RPL .

101212,"My need was to automate turning on the exterior porch lights at dusk and off at dawn - for security purposes. Doing it manually is often forgotten and I can't really it do while away from home at night or on vacation. A home automation system was overkill and expensive. Putting in a light sensor switch on the fixture wouldn't work because the bulb is enclosed and can't detect dawn apart from the light itself. By chance I found this Honeywell timer. It does the job very well, blends in with the existing decor, has a number of programming options, and was easy to install with no rewiring. Details below.Be sure to get the right model! Answer these 3 questions:1) Does your existing light switch have a neutral wire? Green or a bare copper wire is usually ""ground"" - ignore that for this purpose. If you only have 2 other wires on the switch, it's easy: you do not have a neutral. Otherwise you *might* depending on whether or not it is a 3-way switch. Generally newer homes (late 2000s) will have neutrals. See the user's manual on Honeywell's web site for a better description than I can provide. I made the mistake of not noticing the difference - don't do the same! I'm putting this review under both models that I purchased.2) Do you want a simple device that turns on/off at a set time on each day of the week? Or do you want one with a larger back-lit screen, that can do dusk/dawn detection (based on longitude/latitude), and optionally turn it on/off randomly? Go for the ""basic"" or the ""enhanced"" depending on your answer (my words).3) What color: almond (beige) or white?No neutral wire required (40w-500w load, incandescent or halogen only):RPLS530A- white, basicRPLS531A- almond, basicRPLS540A- white, enhancedRPLS541A - almond, enhancedNeutral wire required (0w-1800w load, any bulb or a motor):RPLS730B- white, basicRPLS731B- almond, basicRPLS740A - white, enhancedRPLS741A - almond, enhancedThe disadvantage of the no-neutral version is that it is incompatible with solely energy efficient bulbs (no LED or CFL). Does *not* matter if you meet the minimum load (I confirmed that). It powers itself when the lights are off by bleeding small amounts of power - not enough to turn most traditional lights on, but causes others to flicker. But you *might* be able to make it work if you mix it up - put (1) 40W traditional bulb in with other sockets that have CFL/LEDs.Installation & feature notes:* Be sure to pickup a standard rectangular wall plate to go with it. Nothing custom here - same ones used for those larger paddle-style switches.* After reading the manual it took me ~20 minutes to install and setup.* The timer switch is deeper than a standard switch, so it was difficult for me to get all the wires into the box. It fit, but just barely.* Follow the manual for setting it up. It's easy to read and not difficult to do, but the process is not intuitive on its own.* The backlit model has 3 settings when sitting idle: on, low, off. When you press a key it goes to full brightness for 8 seconds.* You'll need the longitude and latitude of where you live for the enhanced model. There's a list of common cities in the manual, but if you live in a backwoods area you'll need to google it or use a GPS. It's nice to have this because it will adapt to sunrise/sunset automatically depending on the season.* It's very easy to override the timer - just press the big button light a normal switch.* Backup battery keeps your settings in the event of a power outage - nice!",5.0,1,"[0.0, -0.1, -0.5, 0.4, 0.0, 0.31666666666666665, 0.39285714285714285, 0.4, -0.13333333333333333, 0.10277777777777779, 0.0, -0.12499999999999999, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, -0.16666666666666666, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0625, 0.175, -0.125, 0.225, 0.3208333333333333, 0.1621212121212121, -0.08181818181818182, 0.3855555555555556]",1,1

101223,"This is an excellent timer that everyone here has already gone to great lengths detailing. It has a location-based timer that can be set to sunset-to-sunrise fashion, a user-programmable settings, and has a ""random mode"" which simulates someone being home, so that when you go on vacation, it'll look like someone is still in the house. Obviously that only works depending on what you have this hooked up to, but that's another story. I have it on an outdoor light on the front porch that has 4x 60W-equivalent CFL bulbs on it and it does well.THE PROTIP.My tip for you is to keep the chart with the location settings around. I suggest you scan it and leave it as a PDF file somewhere handy or just make a copy of it. Honeywell does not have that sheet on its site, so if you lose it (LIKE I DID...) and you want to change the settings for whatever reason, you might be out of luck. The amazing thing about that though is that the timer keeps its settings even after a blackout, so I didn't really need it. The slightly bad news is that this is probably accomplished using a battery and as far as I know, there's no way to change it. So keep that in mind when you put this in. If you're planning to die with your house, then this is a set-it-and-forget-it kind of device. If you're hoping on moving someplace far after programming this, just keep that little sheet around.EDIT: See comment below for correction.

Like a lot of people, I would like an easy way to have my outdoor lights come on and off automatically.  Normally the problem with timers is that the lights get turned on too early or too late at different times of year due to longer and shorter days, daylight savings time, etc.This switch does solve that problem, allowing the user to have the lights come on and shut off at times related to sunset and sunrise.  I programmed them to come on at 10 minutes after sundown and shut off at 11:30PM.  The nice thing is I no longer have to remember to turn the lights on or off.  You can also turn them on and off manually, which is good.

I have just a few nits with this product worth mentioning.The size of the switch is quite large, and as you will have to retrieve the neutral wires in your outlet box (typically it's a bundle of white wires tied together with a wire nut) it is quite a tight fit.  It does not help that the wire leads from the box are a little on the short side.Second issue is that when the box is ""on"" and providing lighting functions there is an extremely bright blue LED in the lower right corner that is lit.  This light is so bright that it's a bit obnoxious.  The screen itself can be dimmed up or down with three settings but the blue LED is always lit when the lights are on.Third issue is that the mounting screws that come with the box are garbage.  I had to uninstall the box once and repack the wiring and the screws were already stripped with just the use of a high quality flat bladed screwdriver.  Forget about using a power screwdriver.  I ended up pulling the screws from a $2 outlet switch, they were much better.

And then maybe varying daily schedules as well, optionally shifting times to correspond with sunrise and sunset throughout the year.The potential for an overly-complicated product with a confusing interface is high, but I've been delighted at how well all of these things come together in an easy-to-use programmable switch.While I had to crack open the manual for initial setup, it uses genuine English and the process is straightforward. We use the switch for external lights, so it's nice that the display clearly indicates whether or not they're on.

There is one diagram included for the installation. That's it.I had to look up some Youtube videos to figure out how to properly wire the switch in. My load and line wires were both black so I had to test the wiring to make sure I had the two wires properly connected. For a simple light switch it doesn't matter if you mix up the two wires, but for this switch it does matter. A voltmeter would also tell you which one is the load wire but I don't own one.I installed the switch into an outlet with two adjacent light switches. My neutral wires were all neatly twisted together. It's not necessary to separate them for the specific neutral wires for your switch. You can just tie the neutral line from the switch with the rest of the neutral wires.Switch looks very nice after putting on the faceplate which you buy separately. Programming was not too difficult once you figure out the three buttons.One oddity is that the dawn and dusk times were off exactly by one hour.

101258,"This switch is the Honeywell-labeled replacement for the Aube TI071/U. (Aube, a Canadian corporation, was purchased by Honeywell.) I own the Aube-by-Honeywell-labelled switch.This is an easy install for a homeowner who is comfortable enough with electrical work to know why the wiring comes in different colors, and can identify which side of a circuit is ""line"" and which side is ""load."" Also, you must have a neutral (white) wire in the box where you are installing this, or the switch won't work.The switch benefits from Aube's years of experience in designing programmable thermostats that are easy to use. The initial setup involves determining your local latitude and longitude, which can be determined from Aube's web site or from using Google Maps. (You only need the degrees [such as 45 N or 75W], not the minutes or seconds, nor any decimals following the degrees.) The date, time, and location are entered, and your preferences regarding when you want to see the backlight, as well as whether your location is affected by daylight savings time. Once this information is entered, you can program up to eight sets of ON and OFF times.The twist is in the ""Solar Time Table"" function. Entering latitude and longitude means that the switch calculates sunrise and sunset times for each day of the year, and those times are fairly accurate for your location. Therefore, you can set fixed on and off times for a program, or set ON and/or OFF to local sunset or sunrise. You can also adjust a time to be offset from sunset or sunrise, in ten-minute increments up to an hour either way. For my holiday lights, I want them to come on in the evening a half hour before sunset because our sunset comes earlier due to a ridge a mile west of our home. This switch allows that.It is also possible to have the switch turn off the lights a stated number of times at random intervals for a set period (got all that?). This is touted as good for vacation periods, though I have not tried it.In my experience, so-called ""photo eyes"" sometimes cause lights to come on during the day, or at times when they are not wanted. This switch will not let that happen.It is remarkable that Aube/Honeywell built such a degree of flexibility into a small package like this.

Honeywell is much easier to program, especially for non-typical timer schedules. I wanted my fountain to turn on at 8AM and off at 8:30PM. This was very difficult to do with the Intermatic3. Honeywell has a tiny blue 'on' indicator light. I like it, but I could see where if it's in a bedroom or something, it might be objectionable.4. Honeywell's screen is backlit (can be turned off). I find this helpful. If the Intermatic had a backlit screen, the battery would not last long.5. Intermatic semi-failed after 1-1/2 years. It would turn on but had to be manually turned off. I have not had the Honeywell long enough to know whether it will last, but initial thoughts are strong.Bottom line, in my experience, I like the Honeywell a lot.

101272,"Unpacked and installed this programmable switch, my first of this type, today. Installation was easy, once I found the correct circuit to disable at my circuit breaker. Programming was straightforward and I didn't really need to follow along in the instructions except to be sure I was configuring and programming it correctly. The unit is attractive and quite modern-looking. Note that while I am not an electrician, I know enough to do my own wiring throughout the house, and this is simple stuff.Pros* Easy, quick install. All parts (pigtails with protected tips, orange wire nuts) are provided* Requires a neutral wire -- this is a pro because this protects you and your dwelling* Flush, modern and stylistically attractive design* The info panel has three lighting states (hi, lo, off)* The info panel has a clock (of course) and also is programmed with your time zone, offset and lat/lon to be aware of all factors including daylight savings time and sunrise/sunset* Auto and random programming, as well as manual override, are all available* Programming can be tuned to the unit's calculated sunrise and sunset times (this means you won't have it turning on needlessly at 4:30PM in the summer, or too late at, for instance, 8:45PM in winter)* 12/24 hr readout option for confusion-free programmingCons* The depth of the programmable timer will not fit in shallow half-boxes, and may be cramped if your builder or electrician left a lot of Romex in the box. You might want to check inside first, to be sure there's sufficient room for it to fit.* Does not make use of the ground wire -- technically not necessary, but having a post or pigtail would have been nice.Other thoughtsNot a con: as a safety feature one must have a neutral (white) lead in the wall socket. For this reason in addition to the space issue noted as the only 'real' con, you should check your switch box before purchasing. Installation and setup took about seven minutes, once I flipped the appropriate circuit breaker for the room where this is installed. I spent more time caulking around the new switchplate (not included) than I did installing it.The manufacturer can't be expected to include a switchplate with the unit, but I almost forgot to get one until I saw Amazon's &#34;customers also bought...&#34; sidebar. So, don't forget -- this is a standard rectangular device and you'll need a new switchplate if you don't have one like this already. The main product photo shows it with a not-included switchplate.Note: the unit requires line and load to be hooked up correctly. This isn't a con, but it does require you to know which is which. My Romex was in a big knot in the box and I had no labeling to tell me which one was which, so I used a voltmeter to check continuity between the positive ( + ) contact in the light socket and the suspected load hot (black) wire. I guessed correctly the first time (load to positive contact will be continuous, and line to positive won't be). If you are installing this yourself, be double-sure the circuit is off and tests off, and that your neutral isn't also hot (sometimes this is run hot by accident or on purpose for certain circuits). A DVM is your friend here so you don't get zapped.

It is getting harder to find some of the halogen bulbs though so I figured, why not try these.I checked my outlets at home and work to make sure that there was a neutral (white) wire handy and made sure that I hade the appropriate faceplate.  My old mechanical switches worked thru a standard toggle opening AND work in a SPST fashion. That is to say that they open and close the black wire between the &#34;line&#34; and the &#34;load&#34;.These new switches requires GFI/Decorator size opening and must be hooked up with 3 wires.

But on drywall/softwood, they're terrific.Oshlun seems to have a solid reputation in the blade biz, so i tried these after first getting the finer toothed, less-expensive,  HCS version, the MMA 1003. Oshlun uses a funky code on HCS blade model numbers that you need to know to get the right blade for the job. The first 2 digits are the blade quality, tooth characterization, and width: 03= basic HCS, finer tooth, 1 1/3"" width; 04 = basic HCS, finer tooth, 2 2/3"" width; 10 = high precision, coarser tooth, 1 1/3""; 11 = high precision, coarser tooth, 2 2/3"", etc.. The last 2 digits are the size of the pack, and the alphabetic code determines compatibility with various mfgr's oscillating tools. I find this enumeration system unintuitive - but you have to know it to get the right blade for the job. I've found that the coarser 1003 cuts much faster on drywall and soft woods; where the 0303 is easier to control and works better for me on harder woods). the 2 2/3"" blades are useful when you are attempting straight cuts.I recommend that you get up to speed on Oshlun's funky enumeration system before you buy any blades so that you get the best blade for your application. Details and photos are available on the Oshlun site. Amazon doesn't specify TPI, so you have to know the blade code before ordering. All HCS blades are the same quality.I use these on my Bosch multitool as they are OIS compatible. i find them to be just as good as the competition and a less-expensive alternative to the Bosch HCS blades.I hope this helps avoid the confusion I initially had.

The documentation is high quality and doesn't appear to be some kind of mechanical translation from another language, which is a great confidence builder that the manufacturer is building a quality product THROUGHOUT the entire process.  The manufacturing of the lift appears to the naked eye to be as precise as one could need.A Porter Cable 7518 , Speed-a-matic 3.25 HP router motor was installed in the lift.  Installation couldn't have been easier!  Partly because of the quality documentation; but, mostly because the lift came out of the box already configured for the PC 7518.  The docs clearly explain how to adapt the lift for the other routers this lift is designed to accommodate.  All the parts and the tools to accomplish the adaptation are included.  Again, an example of QUALITY manufacturing and a commitment to customer service.After mounting the router motor, the lift was installed in a JessEm router table top.  As expected, it fit perfectly!  The leveling screws installed effortlessly with the included Allen wrench.  After completing the installation, the lift was checked for operation.  Raising and lowering the heavy router was easier than I anticipated.  The mechanical advantage of the lift and the included cranking handle make adjustments as simple as can be.  The locking mechanism secures the motor at the exact height you need.  More about this a little later.To test the new router and lift about 125 feet of 3/4 inch hickory was run through a cabinet door profiling bit.  After an easy setup to get the exact height needed to match the hickory cross members, we ran the hickory.  To assure proper fit, we compared the profile of each piece as it came off the table.  Then, the final check was to compare the first (of 48 pieces) to the last, and the profile was exactly the same.  I am completely satisfied that the locking mechanism holds the router EXACTLY where you need it to be.My only complaint is with the included tool that locks and unlocks the insert rings.  One ring is included with the plate and the tool doesn't align with the holes in the insert ring.  Thinking I might have a bad ring, I tried the tool on each of the new rings that came with the JessEm 02025A 4-Piece Tab-Loc Insert Ring Set, (ordered separately).  All of the holes on each of the 4 other rings align with the insert ring that came with the lift.  Apparently, the nibs on the tool are spaced a little too closely, Or, the tool is misaligned.  Don't know.  But I'll be contracting JessEm to inquire about a replacement.All-in-all FIVE stars for the lift, with a small deduction for the insert tool.

The leveling holes, all ten of them are a real pain to work with, the tapping process is not well done and the set screws don't turn like they should, so be ready to re-tap these holes before using them or you can break the set screws in the holes.  The instructions are fair, pictures are hard to understand what they are trying to show you.  The screw lift works very well along with the lock, the extra rings are an add-on cost and do not come with the base unit like other system so beware of this extra cost.  I found it almost impossible to mount the JessEm Digital Readout Attachment system to it.  The base is not drilled for this unit with the two holes needed and the size of the internal parts makes it almost impossible to mount it within the router plate area.  I know this is a little hard to understand until you try to put it together and put it through the hole in the table top and it doesn't fit through the hole.  You don't expect this to happen when you purchase a complete system from one company.  This is suppose to a quality unit that was designed for professional woodworkers.

Some of the reviews of the Triton were very helpful to me for me to make my decision of which one to purchase, but to do so, I had to e-mail Rockwell to get some important specs that I could not seem to find anywhere about the Jawstand.-It supports 220lbs.-Max jaw opening is about 2"".-The jaws do not actually move to clamp, Instead there is a 1"" square smooth plastic pad that screws in and out in the center on one side and two fixed pads at either end of the other side of the jaw.  IE: the clamp that is about 15"" long only clamps at 3 points in a triangular fashion.  Total clamping surface area is 1 sq."" on one side about 2 sq."" on the other.-the jaw depth is about 2""At the time I purchased it one of the Amazon sellers 'ACME' was selling it for $59 + $7 shipping which made it only a couple of bucks more than the Triton.

101390,"This is an excellent product and idea that was done in by trying to do too much.  Had it just been a clip on desk lamp, I'd say superb.  Or, if they'd streamlined it to be a book light, again, Bravo.  But trying to do both goes too far.Here's the breakdown:THE CONS: I take booklight to mean something that either clips on to my book or to my headboard.  This does both with a secure clip, and the bendy light makes positioning it easy. BUT, because of the magnifying lens attached, it's too heavy.  Too heavy for a hardback book, too heavy to stay in place on the headboard. And that is with the ""base"" off of it.Because it comes with a heavy base for use on a tabletop, the black rectangle in the picture, which allows you to snap it together to have a table light (not using the clip).  This works very well, and is the only way I can use it. The heavyiness of the base allows easy adjustment and it doesn't tip.The problem seems to be in the magnifiying lens.  Why is it there?  If you are reading a book this closely, the lens gets in the way and adds to the weight.  You can't put it between your light and the book without some serious contortions.  And on a table, like a nightstand, it's difficult to focus the light because the magnifying lens is again in the way.Ideally, this would be PERFECT for close craft work.  The magnifying lens would make the most sense then, as well as the light.  But putting them together and calling it a booklight is just missing the niche audience for this product.  Call it a craft light and everyone would be happy.In my case, I'm going to see if I can remove the magnifying lens, leaving just the light, and see if that helps with reading a book.Additionally, be sure to note this is NOT a light to clip on to your Kindle...the clip is too big and too powerful, I think it'd be the end of your screen for sure. In all, for its description it is quite awkward.

101392,"I think it is unfortunate that they labeled this item as a book light. The magnification is intense; so much so that you can see the hairs on gnat's legs but can't see the page because it appears blurred, and that is the regular intensity. The light follows suit. It is a narrow beam with a concentrated light that measures about 3 or 4 inches in diameter. So between blurry over intensity for reading a page in a book (unusable for that) and the narrow beam of intense light, my advice is that if you are getting this in order to clip on your headboard at night, or use it on your desk to read forget it.Ok now that we have that out of the way let's look at what good this lamp and magnifier is good for. I noticed on the box it says, ""Elite LED Magnifier Lamp"". That is a very accurate description. So I am shouting out to the manufacturer, or vendor to change the title here at Amazon. Instead of saying Book Light, say the same thing the box has on it because it really is an excellent, excellent magnifier lamp. If you have ever dealt with the chore of removing a splinter out of your finger, do the job just one time with this magnifier and you will never want to do it again without one. Imagine someone holding a concentrated lamp, and a magnifier at the same time while you are trying to get the perfect distance from the lenses in order to see clearly, and all they have to do is move an inch and you are out of focus. This Normande does it perfectly. If you are working around wood on a regular basis this thing is a must have.Some additional magnificent uses(no pun intended)would be for soldering wires, or for working on watches in order to insert a screw, or anything that you need magnification for. Don't let the bad reviews over weighted with book reading concerns fool you, this thing works great and is superbly engineered as a magnifier.Additional comments. At first I was disappointed that it is powered by two AAA batteries. (Not included) I was hoping for a USB power source or a plug in adapter into 110 AC but it only runs on the batteries. However since this is a specialty magnifier instead of a book reader you are only going to be using it sporadically and usually for a short period of time. If you are into rechargeable batteries then that is an option also.At first I gave it three stars because of how useless it is as a book reader, but then after some additional consideration I moved it up to four because of how well it handles magnification chores, and for that purpose it is highly recommended.",4.0,1,"[-0.04999999999999999, 0.13333333333333333, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3833333333333333, 0.0, 0.5200000000000001, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0, 0.3666666666666667, 1.0, 0.5, 0.3666666666666667, -0.25, 0.0, -0.08333333333333333, -0.03]",1,1

Not because I had heard negative things about the company or their products, but merely because every solar-powered device seems to have some inherent flaw that renders it a less-than-capable tool. Well, Verilux got it right.What do I like about it?* the ReadyLight has, by far, the best overall beam of any flashlight I've owned, with a rich bluish hue, casting a fairly good-sized beam* the battery holds a charge for several hours* saves on the cost of batteries -- not to mention the time wasted scrambling around the house to find batteries that work!* has a good heft to it and feels good in the hand* comes with a 1-year warrantyAnd what do I dislike?* despite the ""rugged"" casing touted by Verilux, the housing actually feels a little cheap to me -- especially the On/Off switch and the Carabiner clip. This isn't a huge issue, but I think for the price point, many folks might be expecting a little more* an adjustable beam would have been a nice feature, but again, not a deal breaker by any meansI haven't tried the ReadyLight in outdoor applications, so I have to withhold any reviews of its water resistant design.

The manufacturer claims that the light holds the charge for up to 12 months...and that you can get 4 hours of light. While I haven't had it long enough to tell you if it will hold the charge for a year, but what I can tell you right now is that you will need a Phillips head screw driver and small fingers to put the battery pack into the light. l had neither on hand and so it was frustrating for me to add the batteries to it.There really are no directions so you have no clue as to how long to charge your light, if it needs to stay in the sunlight every day, if you need to discharge the batteries as another reviewer mentioned how to do so, can the bulbs be replaced, what exactly is water RESISTANT?. So as far as I'm concerned there are no instructions/directions and the while the product is sort of user intuitive is not totally user intuitive and that makes this something I probably will not recommend.It is quite light and that makes a good change for me although you cannot use it into a self-defense weapon as you can with a large Maglit!The LED lights do make it a tad brighter than my Maglite but it is not as concentrated beam of light as a traditional flashlight.

101422,"After a nasty ice-storm in October (where we were without power for five days!), I began to invest in some emergency items for our home. I chose the Verilux flashlight for just such an occasion. Here is my experience:Pros:-This flashlight is ergonomic. Finger grooves run down one side of the device. This makes it exceptionally comfortable to hold for a sustained period ... and, it also provides for a decent grip. (However, I think that if the product had little rubber segments on these grooves, it would be even more comfortable and better in inclement weather).-The carabiner on the end is a brilliant bonus. It opens with genuine ease (those who are suffer from arthritis or similar conditions would have little trouble with this large lever that requires minimal pressure to open and then closes securely). Moreover, the aperture is oversized and can accommodate most curtain/shower rods.-The light is intense and bright white (not that typical yellow-white light). The projected ray is about the circumference of a typical flashlight. (I thought it might be a little larger since several bulbs are in-use simultaneously. But in reality, it meets all lighting needs. No worries there.)-Extraordinarily lightweight. The body of the flashlight is flat and thin ... much different from my cylindricalMag-Lite(which is a ""paperweight""). And, I thought the plastic case would look ""cheap,"" but the construction is so immaculate that it averts any such derogatory label.)-The solar charge panel is a welcome, ""green"" touch. And the panel consumes an entire side of the flashlight ... so it receives a genuinely full-charge.Potential con:-The battery-pack for this flashlight is pretty expensive. (But it comes with a battery pack that should not need replacing any time soon).-The glowing ring (so that one can quickly locate the device in a power-outage) is a bit too skinny. I experimented with it in a completely dark-room.

I dropped it and had I not found it after much searching, I would've had to use tape to keep the battery from falling out... the screw is not optional for keeping the battery door on. The second has to do with the battery they chose, a common cordless phone battery, good for lots of trickle charges, but lousy at holding power for long periods of time. After my initial tests it sat around a room without direct sun light for about 3 weeks, when I turned it back on there was no significant light coming from it and it died completely in seconds.

It was much brighter than any other flashlight I own, for this purpose alone.The on/off button is very smoothe and makes no noise whatsoever, just simply press it on and off. Perfect if you need to keep very quiet. Even though my hands are quite small, the grip on the flashlight is perfect in my hand. It has nice indentations for your palm and fingers and it feels good there. It's not a heavy flashlight but it feels strong and durable. What came to mind, is that it could also do some damage if someone came up behind you in the dark and tried to overcome... you could give them a good smack on the head, enough to startle them and perhaps enough time to get away.

101452,"The biggest frustration I had with this otherwise fairly nice flashlight is that the battery pack is not installed prior to shipping and unfortunately getting the battery pack to fit completely within the cavity that exists in the ""handle"" or ""barrel"" of this flashlight wasn't quite as simple as it seemed.  There was a note indicating that the battery pack had to be installed in a specific orientation/way and that was all fine, well, and good, but actually having the pack fit within the space left me thinking that the space that was set aside should have been a little deeper and less likely to have obstructions within it that would keep the battery pack from fitting completely within that space, in turn keeping the cover from going back on as snuggly as it should.The cover for the battery pack could also be considered just a bit of an annoyance as it makes use of a small Phillips head screw necessitating the use of a small Phillips head screwdriver.  Not that I don't have a few of those around, having collected several along the way, back in the heyday of computer expositions and such where small screwdrivers were handed out like candy all in the name of advertising companies that were in their prime during that time.(I could detour a bit and mention how funny it is that I still have all of those old screwdrivers even though many of the companies advertised on them have gone on to the company graveyards, combined into other companies, out of business because their business models were never updated, driven out during the bursting of the tech bubble, etc.)In any case, once the battery pack is installed I really can't say I have any complaints about this flashlight.  I like having it around and knowing that I should be use it at just about any time without worrying too much about whether or not the battery was charged up.  Going through a few days without electricity compliments of a power company that has been loath to spend money on preventative maintenance measures (tree pruning and such) combined with the inevitable tropical storms that we get seemingly each year has left me buring through flashlights several times in my past.  Though I try to keep a collection of several LED flashlights around, they all take ""disposable"" batteries.  I could put rechargeable batteries in them, but they don't tend to last that long and always have to be charged in a wall-wart type charger that occupies a socket and space in the power strip or on the wall.  Granted, I do keep some ""emergency"" lights around that are always on stand-by and I appreciate that they just work when the power goes out, but they too do run out and they also occupy space in the wall sockets.With this nice rechargeable the charging is all ""free"" compliments of the solar panel on the side of the handle.  All I really need to do is put this light in a place where it will continue to get exposed to sunlight and that's it.All said, a fairly highly recommended device.  If the manufacturer put a little more effort into improving the battery installation -- such as making use of a bigger screw to lock the cover in place (one that would use a coin easily found in pocket change to turn) as well as correcting my initial problem with the compartment for the battery being too cramped, then I could easily see this being a 5-star device.

101453,"I'm an old guy and my standard work flashlight is a heavy black aluminum rechargeable Maglite that lives in its charger/mount in my garage.  It's super bright, rechargeable and always charged, and very rugged (although if you drop it while turned on, the bulb will probably go out).  I love the Maglite and really have not been in the market for a replacement.  I used one for over 20 years in my highway patrol career.  But . . . now that I gave this Verilux Readylight a go, how is it working out?Run Time and Battery:  The run time of the Readylight under use seems to be as promised - nearly 4 hours.  The Maglite run time is 1.5 hours or less depending on the age and number of cycles on the battery.  The Maglite battery stick lasts a couple of years but will eventually need replacing, at a cost of $20 and up.  The Readylight uses a small NiMh triple battery pack, same as is used in many cordless phones.  It will eventually wear out, but should still last a couple years or more.  It can be replaced for less than $10 and is easier to find (Wal-Mart) than the Maglite bulb.Brightness and Bulb:  The Maglite has an ultra-bright white halogen bulb.  The bulb does have a limited lifespan and a new one must purchased when the old one burns out, which it will.  As I mentioned, dropping the light when on will also knock the bulb out.  The light from the Readylight is produced via six LEDs.  They are not nearly as bright as the the Maglite, but produce a surprisingly bright light which I find to be more diffused, as opposed to the searing white spotlight capability of the Maglite.  The Readylight is adequate. Maglite has a glass lens.  Readylight lens is plastic.Ruggedness:  The heavy spun aircraft aluminum Maglite can double as a hammer . . . and has.  The Readylight has an attractive glossy ABS plastic finish and is remarkably light.  This lightness is a plus in most cases, but I really don't know how rugged it is.  You definitely won't be hammering with it.  Again, if you drop the Maglite when on, you may knock the bulb out.  Not so with the Readylight - the LED's should take the shocks easily and bulb life will probably exceed the lifespan of its owner.  Readylight is water resistant.  So is the Maglite.Charging:  Maglite has a charger sleeve and charges fully overnight. It needs HOURS, similar to the Readylight. You must have house current available of course for the Maglite charger.  Readylight charges in 10 hours of direct sunlight.  With a 4 hour run time, it shouldn't be hard to keep it generally charged and ready to go about all the time.  The Readylight has a built in solar panel charger on the side - there is no other means of charging available.Cost: I paid about $100 for my Maglite Magcharger setup.  The Readylight comes for a fraction of that.Which is best?  Hard to say.  The Readylight is certainly cheaper to buy and maintain, but will it last?  The quality of lite from the Maglite is far superior.  Readylight charges with only sunlight and has over double the run time of Maglite.  I'm really used to my rugged Maglite and will probably continue to use it in the garage.  My Readylight sits on a kitcken window sill (to maintain charge) and is available for power outages, general household needs, or camping outings.  I think the lightweight Readylight would also be an excellent choice for the car (trunk or glovebox), as long as the owner thinks to lay it out on the dashboard every few months for a sunlight charging session.",5.0,1,"[-0.06666666666666667, 0.41111111111111115, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, -0.16666666666666666, 0.0, 0.08333333333333333, 0.25, 0.1777777777777778, 0.05497835497835498, 0.4, 0.4, 0.25, 0.3333333333333333, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6000000000000001, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.43333333333333335, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1, -0.013888888888888886, 0.23125, 1.0, -0.2916666666666667, 0.10714285714285714, 0.39999999999999997, 0.0, 0.2, 0.22500000000000003, 0.25]",1,1

It has a fairly bright wide beam.  (Con: No spotlight, but that didn't matter to me.)

Either that or be ready to store it on a windowsill where it can be ready whenever needed.  I have a bright kitchen so it works perfectly for me.

101457,"For brightness comparison this Verilux  (when fully charged) is as bright as my 2AA Maglight but nowhere near as bright as my 3D cell Maglight.Positives:Charges through a windowpane.  This means you can leave it laying in the back of your car window and you will have a charged flashlight when you need it.  It also means you can simply store it on a windowsill in the house.Did several, charge and discharge cycles.  Runs at almost full brightness for 4 hours, then for 2 hours more slowly dimming.Recharged in 6 hours on the windowsill on a bright day in New Mexico.  Took 8 hours on a more cloudy day.Glow in the dark ring is a nice touch, although it is not extremely bright.Excellent for camping trips as it is light and does not require replacement batteries.Negatives:You have to store this in sunlight, no throwing it in a drawer. It uses a NiMH battery with a proprietary connector.  NiMH discharge at about 25% per month so you need to keep it in the sun.  Don't charge it up then store it someplace and expect it to be working months later.  I don't know if this flashlight uses the slower discharge type of NiMH though.  NiMH do have a memory effect (voltage depression over many cycles) , but it is not as intense as NiCd.  If you find the flashlight is not bright enough after many cycles, then let it run all the way down and recharge it several times in a row to ""refresh"" the battery.I have had a problem in the past with the plastic cover of solar panels degrading  and clouding over in the intense sunlight (and UV) we get in New Mexico.

I don't think it's 2.5x brighter than conventional flashlights like the manufacturer claims, but it's at least as bright as a standard flashlight. That is not always the case with all solar flashlights.-The handle has a grip that allows for a comfortable and natural hold.-There is a glow strip around the lens that helps you find the light in the dark. Cool feature.-The 6 LED bulbs provide a nice, white daylight illumination.-The charge will give you four hours of light.-The end has a carbiner type hook at the end that can attach to a beltloop or backpack.-It's pretty cool and futuristic looking.-The manufacturer states it holds a charge for a year.-The battery is easy to install (some have complained it's difficult. I used a standard philips screwdriver and my fingers, took less than 30 seconds)-It's light weight.-Mine came already charged.What I didn't like:-You can only use Verilux batteries and they have to be ordered from Verilux. They cost $9.95 each plus $6.95 S&H.; What??? I'm pretty sure you can find generic batteries that fit either online or at Radio Shack.-It takes 10 hours to charge (as stated in the directions).

101508,"Just received these. 2 to a package. Small, very light, attractive design, relatively small solar panels on top. Fit and finish are fine.One important feature that I like about these lanterns is there is no bottom plate, so the light emitter is free to illuminate a full circle below the hanging light as well as out the sides. UPDATE: Its not as bright as the photo promises.Hanging wire bail and hooks include a versatile 'alligator' style clip for attaching to a wire or umbrella frame, so very versatile options for hanging.The box states they will illuminate for up to 8 hours, 2 hours of light for each hour of sunlight charging. There's no indication of how many Lumens these put out. There's an On-Off switch for the lights. UPDATE: dim. I guesstimate from 2 to 4 lumens max.The instructions state that, before first use, these lights need to be left in the sun charging for two days (48 hours) with the automatic light sensor turned Off, so the battery absorbs but cannot discharge energy. I've never had a solar light require that before. Not sure if that means the Ni-Mh batteries are of substandard rating, or have memory effect issues, or what.Anyway, I'll be charging these in the sun for the next 2 days. Then I'll try out the lights for a few nights.And then I'll update this review with whether I'm satisfied with these lights.UPDATE: OK, after charging the lights for the suggested 48 hours, these are hard to describe. You'll love 'em or hate 'em. They are designed to a very different aesthetic than the standard Home Depot solar lawn/garden lights.They are dim, as other reviewers have stated. I will guesstimate between 2 to 4 Lumens. Most lawn solar lights at Home Depot nowadays are 6 to 10 lumens, for comparison.The light quality is unusual-- &#34;ghostly&#34;, like pale moonlight from a strong full moon. It's slightly blue in tint. The lantern globe itself does not &#34;light up&#34; from a distance. The light is about as strong as an LED light you might find on a phone charger to indicates its working.Indoors, hung overhead in a dark room, it casts a distinct wide circle of pale light underneath and gives enough light to navigate by, not enough light to read or do detailed tabletop tasks YMMV.Hung outside on a patio it gives a subtle 'moonlight' effect that is very different from a candle or typical yard and garden solar light.So if you want very subtle moonlight effect, and that's all you want, these are the lights for you. They would be nice for use in a dim corner or possibly a stealth camping use, but one by itself is not sufficient light to hang over an outdoor dinner table for 6 people to try to eat by. Garden path lighting, yes. When suspended at 6' they throw off a light circle of at least 12 feet radius.They did glow steadily for 6 hours before I turned them off (switch is on underside by the light emitter). They do throw off a strong shadow like the ad photo, but it's been photoshopped to make the light appear whiter and higher wattage. The bulbs are plastic, like 2-liter soda bottles, light passes right through without glare so the lantern globe itself doesn't 'light up' like most 'frosted 'solar lanterns.For the low price I'll definitely keep them. That low price means you might want to compensate for the low Lumens level by just getting a bunch and scattering them around your area...they're compact and extremely light and definitely cheap. No idea as to longevity.For a Prepper looking to prolonged power outages, these offer more possibilities than as landscape lights. Hung indoors they are like a nightlight, enough light to navigate a room and locate objects and do familiar tasks. One per room might be a good plan.They're easy to walk around with as a personal lantern, ultralight and the hanging loop with alligator clip makes it possible to clip it to a pack strap, a jacket, anything.

101526,"One unusual feature of thisLighting EVER 6 Watt LED Bulbis that it has a white ceramic heat sink. In contrast, the body of a typical LED bulb is made of an aluminum heat sink. The ceramic heat sink may offer the psychological benefit of being safer, since ceramic is electrically non-conductive. But whether it is as effective as aluminum heat sink is questionable. Previously I have tested theLighting EVER 7 Watt LED Light Bulbwith similar heat sink design, and it burned out after just two weeks. This 6W version, however, seems to be doing well after one full month of usage.The power consumption of this LED bulb, according to myKill-A-Watt Electricity Usage Monitor, is 6W as advertised. Note that some other LED bulbs, such as the Filite A19 5W Led Light Bulb, may consume more power than advertised. Its Power Factor is only 0.62, which is not so good. (Lower power factor means more power is wasted in the transmission of energy)In side-by-side comparison with three other LED bulbs, this Lighting Ever 6W LED bulb is smaller in size (see photos I unloaded to 'Customer Images' section). It appears to have the similar brightness as other bulbs in the 6-7 watt, 400-500 lumen range. Its color temperature is slightly more bluish compared toLG LED BulbandLWS A19 LED Bulb, even though they are all called ""warm white"".I must take issue with the manufacturer's claim that this 6W LED bulb is a ""50W Incandescent Bulb Replacement"", because the latter actually generates about 650 lumens of light output. A 400 lumen LED bulb can only be called a ""40W equivalent"" at best. The tricky part is that: the beam from this (and most other) LED bulb is concentrated in the forward direction. So when you look at the bulb from in front, it appears as bright as a 50W incandescent bulb. But when viewed from the side, it becomes much dimmer. That means this bulb works best in a recessed light fixture shinning down, but not good for upward-facing position in a chandelier or floor lamp.Overall, this inexpensive Lighting EVER 6W LED bulb performed reasonably well (so far). But I have to minus one star for its deceptive claim of ""50W Equivalent"".[Update on Jan 2, 2013]I opened the dead Lighting EVER 7W LED bulb, and found a busted polymer capacitor due to overheating. I also discovered that the bulb has no power regulation at all. There are just 60 tiny LEDs driven directly from rectified AC input.

You hook the black hot wire up to the L connection and then have a jumper wire that goes from the L connection to the other lamp and connect that wire to the other L connector in the same parallel way.  You hook the white (neutral they say) wire to the ""N"" connector and then connect a jumper wire from that N connector to the other one where the other light fits in.  I don't explain it as well as the other reviewer.  You totally disable the ballast wires since the ballast is not used at all.  Hopefully this has been of some help.  It's really not that hard if you draw a diagram of where the wires are to go.  If I were really talented with video, I would show you in that way (a series of pictures is worth a million words, to paraphrase).",4.0,1,"[0.011904761904761904, 0.3, -0.0031250000000000028, 0.08333333333333333, -0.75, 0.039999999999999994, 0.1375, 0.1, 0.0, -0.027777777777777776, 0.037500000000000006, -0.125, 0.0, 0.0, -0.19583333333333336, 0.5]",1,1

101541,"I thought I would try these in my garage fixtures to replace two sets of lights that had their ballasts going bad.  Here is what I liked:1.  Great shipping with the bulbs well protected in individual tubes with protective covers on the pins and then these heavy cardboard tubes where put into a shipping container.2.  Light fixtures were very easy to rewire.  Since all of the tombstones were individually wired, no jumper between sides, I could select the side I wanted to supply power to.3.  Lights come on full power, no warm up period.4.  I found the lights to be well made with no lose circuit boards or other issues that have been mentioned by others.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  These bulbs are listed as warm white, but the color rendering is closer to pink rather than the yellowish white that they should be.  It is EXTREMLY noticeable when you have warm CFL tubes next to these!!!  The light temperature listed does not seem to be the same as what other LED light manufacturers use.  I have some LED recessed fixtures over my work bench with warm white LED bulbs that list the same color temperature and the color is not even close!!2.  These bulbs were designed for tombstones that are mounted 90 degrees from the ceiling.  If they are mounted that way, the LEDs point toward the floor.  If you have light fixtures where the tombstones are mounted at an angle, the LEDs wind up pointing toward the walls.  This creates a low light level directly under the light fixtures.3.  These lights do not start right away and they blink twice before lighting.  Reminds me of the old CFL bulbs with the mechanical starters that blinked twice before they light.  There is about a two second delay before the lights start.Overall, I am not happy with the color and so will return them and try the bright white lights instead.  The delay in starting I can live with.  The requirement for 90 degree mounted tombstones I can correct.  The color, that just does not work for me.Because of the light color issue, I cannot recommend these lights.",3.0,1,"[-0.6999999999999998, 0.3, 0.4816666666666667, 0.0, 0.024999999999999994, 0.09583333333333334, 0.3, 0.16875, 0.19999999999999998, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.225, 0.2857142857142857, 0.25, 0.06000000000000001, 0.06818181818181818, 0.0, 0.4]",1,0

I may add a pair of warm white for a slightly warmer mix, but I'm rather happy with the intensity, and area coverage. These lights don't waste light in all directions like the old fluorescent tubes did, which makes it much easier on the eyes. The distance from the lights to the floor is 9 feet, so I can imagin the intensity would be even brighter in a 8 foot high installation.

Look for it, take a picture of the diagram, and print it out for use with installing the tubes.If you can get over the cost of these tubes, it's well worth the admission price to enjoy great lighting at a reduced operating costs.I was concerned about how these tubes would perform based on how led bulbs performed, but these really restore my faith in LED lighting.UPDATE:LED lighting tends to be a bit directional in nature, so if you'd like to spread the lighting more evenly across the room, just roll the outer tubes between 5 and 10 degrees toward the outside of the fixture, and you'll duplicate more closely the spread you were used to with the old flourescent, but you'll still enjoy much better quality of light. :)",5.0,1,"[0.4, 0.4, 0.30833333333333335, 0.2, 0.16, 0.2, 0.0, 0.3727272727272728, 0.0]",1,1

There is one small pamphlet that comes with the unit, which doesn't really help with installation.  Our biggest question was whether or not the unit's wires were stranded copper or aluminum; this is important because connecting aluminum wires to copper wires is a fire hazard and since we were stringing these all over the basement we needed to buy the proper wire to connect them.  The wires on the unit are either 22 or 24 gauge stranded copper; another issue is finding wire that small at Home Depot.  We instead bought spools of wire off Amazon.

101560,"For around $30, the Nebo ProTec Elite HP190 is an excellent value in a nicely made, acceptably durable, impressively bright, securely attachable, easy-to-operate light for your bedside home defense pistol.Several of the negative reviews complain that this light stops functioning after a varying number of fired rounds (between 20 to 500 shots). I mean no disrespect, but those reviewers completely miss the point. This light is NOT intended for use at the range. It is not designed for service on a duty pistol or in prolonged combat conditions. It is an affordable solution that is durable enough to survive a ONE TIME DEFENSIVE SHOOTING in the rare event someone breaks into your home at night and you have to fire your weapon. I am confident this light will serve well for years of checking out things that go bump in the night and for identifying a potential intruder so that you can distinguish, for example, between a dangerous intruder and a son or daughter who comes home from college in the middle of the night to ""surprise"" mom and dad.If you do need to fire your gun, I have every confidence this light will survive at least a dozen rounds on any ""tame"" pistol with average to light recoil. That makes it perfectly adequate for home defense. Sure, you may need to replace it after a violent encounter, but that's not the point. This product is intended, realistically, for the many consumers who don't want to pay $200 for a ""combat ready"" light because they don't need it to survive hundreds (or thousands) of rounds of gunfire, or to endure rugged survivalist conditions. They just need something solidly built to illuminate dark corners while freeing up their support hand for other tasks (turning a doorknob, holding a child's hand to guide them to safety, etc.).If you want a light for the shooting range, for ""bugging out,"" or for some other rugged or high-intensity scenario, you really ought to spend considerably more money to get a well-proven, combat-ready light. But if you're looking for an affordable way to improve your safety in a home defense situation (and you understand this light isn't designed for prolonged gunfire) this is an excellent value and a great choice.Some notes about the Nebo ProTec Elite HP190's functionality:Attaching it to the rail on my Beretta 92A1 was simple. Pull down on the spring loaded jaw tensioner, slide it onto the rail, tighten the screw as much as possible by hand, then snug it up an extra quarter-turn with a coin. The light locks onto the rail very securely, with no wiggle or slippage. On my (full size) 92A1, the front end of the light is about 1/4"" shorter than the muzzle. That means there is no risk of muzzle flash/pressure ""knocking out"" the light on the first blast, and the heavy frame of my pistol dampens the 9mm recoil so much that I am certain this light will bear the shock of at least the first dozen rounds. I'm not sure I'd trust this light on a much shorter pistol (with the light ahead of the muzzle) or when firing a substantially larger (harder-recoiling) caliber, both of which would run a much higher likelihood of causing the light to fail on the first few shots. I still don't know if that's a deal-breaker, but be sure you consider it. Relative position to the muzzle and caliber/recoil are probably the main reasons for the widely varying reports about this product's durability.When activated, the center of the beam throws an ultra-bright circle of white light (approximately 10"" to 12"" in diameter at 10 feet) that is perfectly aligned with the point of aim on my gun's sights. Outside that circle, it also casts a noticeably softer, more dispersed (yet bright) light capable of illuminating a very broad area (an entire 2-car garage!). That means you can see whatever may be hiding or moving in the periphery, but your shots will go wherever you naturally point the bright center of the beam. Think of it like an over-sized laser pointer... whatever you illuminate with the bright central circle is almost certainly what you will hit when you pull the trigger. I think these beam qualities are ideal for home defense--allowing for quick, instinctive target-acquisition as well as offering ample illumination for average sized rooms, at average (close-quarters) fighting distances, with ample brightness to blind a potential assailant.To activate the light, you press the side-mounted slide switch from the right to left (using the trigger finger of your strong hand if you're right-handed). To turn it off, you press it the opposite way from left to right (using your weak/support hand if you're right-handed). If you turn it ON-OFF-ON quickly (in less than four seconds), it switches to a rapid strobe mode, which can be useful to disorient an attacker. If you leave the light off for more than four seconds, however, it resets so that the next time you turn it on, it will default to steady-on mode.DOWNSIDES?

101564,"Pros:Light weightDurable (aside from the on off switch)Bright light.Cons:Toggling throughout the different settings on the light is weird. It requires turning on and off the light multi times. To set it to steady light you have to set it to the strobe then turn it off. The next time it comes it will change to the correct setting.If you have a tight fitting holster or even a fabric tac holster this thing can and will turn on during the holster/upholstering process.The on off switch needs serious improvement. It is not a ambidextrous switch, push it on the right side to turn it on and the left to turn it off. Vs once on either side to turn it on and once more to turn it off. This is simply not practical for any law enforcement application. Fumbling around with your gun light.  Also the switch is pretty flimsy I have not yet but I could easily snap this off with my hands or getting it snagged on some thing. The switch design is simply garbage.Advertised as &#34;compact&#34; it is not. This sticks 3/4 inches fwd of the composite and a 1/2 inch fwd of the barrel. This is on a full size xd 40. It also hangs 1/4 inch lower than the trigger guard. They put a weaver style rail on the bottom which is nice but not practical as attaching anything else to a hand gun would make it very bulky and would not fit in any holster.Mine came with no install instructions. Nor instructions on how to adjust settings.Overall: it works for what I need it for, I don't need to grab a second article for those bump in the night situations, I never conceal carry this weapon so for home application it works just fine.

101573,"This light is advertised as 190 lumens but my Mag Lite XL50 hand flashlight, rated at 140 lumens, is a little brighter.  I would put this light at around 120, mind you I'm just guessing, relative to the XL50 that is.  I felt compelled to rate it down one star due to the low light level compared to their advertised value but the light is perfect other than a few numbers on a description so five stars it is.However, this snapped onto my Springfield XDM 40 compact just right with a couple of mm to the trigger guard so it works out fine.  The front of the light extends 1 1/16&#34; past the muzzle.  Sighting my pistol I've found the light is almost exactly centered.  If I had to within very close range I'm sure I can hit a larger target without actually using my sights.The on switch is ideal for a right handed person since the switch is on the right side.  You can press it laterally with your trigger finger to turn it on and the switch will come out the left side, which you press to turn off.  If you turn it off then on again within a few seconds it goes into strobe mode.  I was worried my trigger finger would be too short but it just barely can reach the switch so I'm happy.  I'm 5'6&#34; and my hand is medium sized.There was one reviewer that said it fell off.  Well, if you don't know how to put it on it'll fall off.  You press the front latch down as you slide it on then release it to latch onto the rail.  Now, if you're not very smart you think it's on and of course it'll fall off.  You HAVE to tighten the screw which will press the sides together tightly and nothing short of breaking the plastic will knock it off and that plastic is actually very sturdy.Part of the reason I decided on this item is because it uses a relatively common battery, the CR 123.

The handle is round enough (ennough diameter) that it sits comfortable in your hand.  The light easily shines straight across a hundred feet of a yard, in the dark.  The only drawbacks are 1) the red band around the top is un-necessary and I often wonder if it lets precious light out un-necessarily, diminishing the actual beam, and 2) the flared front end, while marketed as ""tactical"" serves no purpose.  The light would be much more streamlined if this flare was not there, and the edges are a little sharp.  Not cut-your-finger sharp, but still.

101596,"Nebo Redline arrived today on time (as usual) via Amazon prime.  Packaging was only a non descript plastic bag with a sticker on it to seal it closed (customer return?). I am a flashlight fan with several unique types.  Overall, I like the performance of the light it produces and the choices of beam make this an excellent choice for multiple applications but there are several dumb ideas that take a very good concept from 5 stars to 3.The Great Points:  220 lms of bright white light.  I compared it outside next to my highly rated Dorcy 41-4750 180 lms and the beam on the redline seemed to be brighter.  The focusing system if first rate.  Just the right amount of tension and degree of angle (wide to tight). 3 AAA batteries are easy to get and run time is as good or better than most especially with the high output. 4 beam choices make this very versital.  The fact that you can leave it on the preferred mode is great.The Good Points:  Tactical knurled grip is well designed.  It is very small (maybe too small) which perfect for back packs, cars and police/tactical belt.  It has a unique red ring.  Not really sure it serves any purpose but looks cool.  Glow in the dark on/off button could be handy if you dropped it in the dark.The not so good points:  Packaging could have just been a fluke so I will mention but let that one slide.  Rear on/off button is really difficult to access and in a defense situation would be a huge problem and basically eliminates the use of this flashlight as a potentially life saving tactical light.

101603,"I purchased my initial Redline light because of the distance lighted, but then bought the similar 5620. Here are the advantages of each.  First let me say both are terrific considering the cost and power.  I wanted a way to illuminate the open land behind my house and on impulse picked up the 5581 at my local hardware store because its sign claimed it would throw a beam 125 yards.  It does.  I wasn't even looking for the other features, but then got to comparing lights with a neighbor and realized I'd fallen into a great little flashlight.  Had I known what I was looking for I could have gotten it for less here.One thing to know about these extra bright long distance beams; they reflect off whatever they hit first so if there is brush or trees in your line of sight, you will see those illuminated but not beyond. If you have a clear long distance path both lights give a good view of objects over 100 yards away.The 5581 is an impressive looking little light in silver with good heft, an aggressive top collar, more functionality than I expected and it does indeed throw a beam to my back pasture fence when you turn the collar to focus the beam, plus it lights up a good sized area when in diffused mode.  It fits in a pocket easily.  My neighbor was particularly impressed that it did the SOS automatically since he is an outdoorsman and recognized the value.  I like the ability to check out things at a great distance, plus illuminate a book close at hand with a lower light setting.  I quickly got the hang of cycling through the different functions to the one I wanted, but also appreciated that I could just use the strongest light every time I turned the thing on if I wanted too, by waiting five seconds before clicking it on again.  Clicking it on and off more rapidly allows cycling through the functions.I didn't understand at first about the aggressive collar and wondered why it actually seemed rather sharp at the edges, but it could come in handy if needed.  The magnetic base also didn't register with me at first, but sure would be useful for changing a tire or for car emergencies.  The magnet is strong enough to hold the light sticking straight out on a refrigerator without budging.The more I thought about uses for the light, the more I wanted to keep it in the car so I looked for another and settled on the 5620 which I really love.  It has enhancements over the slightly smaller 5581.  It is longer by about "", bigger around and heavier, so that's an issue if you intend to carry it hiking, but it is more convenient to carry for me because of the wrist strap (has a belt clip too but wouldn't fit over a thick belt--seems better suited for pocket or waistband).  Although it has a higher lumen rating, I didn't see a noticeable difference in the amount of light thrown at a distance.The 5620 has a lot of moveable parts where the 5581 only screws the beam from diffused to focused.  Of course you can unscrew the ends of both to change the well thought out battery pack (3 AAA batteries in the flashlights to begin with and the 5620 comes with three more in the box) or to remove the lens, but otherwise the 5581 has only the function button on the base where the 5620 has two other moveable collars.  One thin one near the top can be swiveled down to hide the red ring that lights up when the lights are on, which makes you harder to find in the dark and the other near the base serves to set the function you want so you don't have to cycle through them all by clicking the button multiple times.  It also keeps the light from rolling if placed on a flat surface and because this ring protrudes it allows me to easily grip the light between my index and middle fingers and click the button on or off with my thumb.  While this can be done with the smaller 5581, it's awkward and mostly I need two hands to turn it off and on or grip the light with my whole hand and use my index finger to click the button (the button on the 5581 is harder to push than on the 5620).Bottom line, the smaller, less complex and less expensive 5581 seems just as powerful to me, has a longer battery life and all the same functions, while the 5620 is easier to use.  Being able to set the functions on the 5620 via the ring, easily turn it on/off one-handed, hide the red ring and carry it via a strap are the tie breakers.",5.0,1,"[0.13333333333333333, 0.125, -0.13333333333333333, 0.0, 0.1625, 0.14666666666666667, 0.3552083333333333, 0.43333333333333335, 1.0, 0.6000000000000001, 0.23333333333333334, 0.24500000000000002, 0.062499999999999986, 0.36666666666666664, 0.08333333333333333, 0.21666666666666667, -0.10625000000000001, -0.0936868686868687, 0.2416666666666667, -0.03333333333333333, 0.3111111111111111]",1,1

101610,"I've had my Nebo Redline for several years, and I've enjoyed it for the most part. Judging from other tests I've seen along with my own experiences, the lumen output looks to be slightly overrated. The flashlight only approaches its rated brightness when using it on the narrowest beam setting; once you begin widening the beam, the brightness falls off quickly. The magnet on the rear is fairly weak, so it has trouble keeping the light attached to certain metals, but it's still handy from time to time. Unfortunately, the magnet also attracts metal dust and flakes, so the area around my power button has gotten fairly gunked up from on-the-job use in industrial plants. The power button glows in the dark for a while if exposed to light for a few seconds first, and pressing it multiple times with cycle through various power and strobe modes (full, medium, and low power, then S.O.S. strobe and finally full-brightness rapid strobe). The last strobe setting is bright enough that you could temporarily disorient someone with it.This light, however, is only ""tactical"" in name and aesthetics. While the signature ""redline"" band looks great in use, it also creates a critically weak point on the flashlight. The redline section is made of plastic, and it is what attaches the upper lens section to the main body of the flashlight. If you drop this light, you stand a good chance of breaking the redline plastic (and its threads that screw into the flashlight's main body). Once you do that, it's all over. You could glue/epoxy the lens housing back into place permanently, but that means no longer being able to turn the lens housing to adjust the beam, so you'd better glue it on the setting you like best. We've been using ours without the lens housing for several months now as an around-the-house light, and it works well enough as a wide casting flood light. There is a small dome lens directly on top of the LED, so we don't have to worry about touching or breaking that part. It's just infinitely less versatile without the ability to focus the light into a tight beam or a more focused flood.A nice-looking flashlight with a low buy-in cost, largely positive reviews, and decent-enough power.

And I suspect it is the only flashlight in its class of brightness, that has a magnetic base to attach to duct work, iron grid, car hoods, metal tables, etc, which makes this an super valuable, unbeatable combination !!!  On day 4 of owning this, it was dropped 8 feet to a hard floor and it still works.  I also carry and use a LED maglite (for now) but the maglite (with low lumen output) will soon be left at home.  But still, I wish this Nebo light would fit in my Maglite world of holsters and tool pockets slots.  This Nebo is the Mecca of small flashlights, A Must Have !Nov 2011 update. I no longer use my AA LED maglites (too dim). My first purchased Nebo high lamp (220 lumens) setting stopped working after a few months of use. Burned out I guess.  Since no other product comes close to this one, with a magnetic base, I ordered a 3 pack. I'm still a believer, dispite being very worried about the short life span of my first purchase. Also, just today, I dropped my Nebo from 12 ft to a hard floor while it was on and lamp hot. It did not break and was still lit!Nebo holsters are a problem,,,the Nebo holster sticks above my belt line and digs into my side and the clip can come loose after daily use for 3 months.  And the leather cover on the belt clips rips open after a few months of daily use and that makes it really hard to put the device on your belt each morning.The popular generic nite-ize [...]  holster is a bit difficult to insert the flashligh body into.

If $25 seems like a lot for a flashlight, and you're a value shopper, then the CSI 8 is an excellent alternative.A year ago, I discovered the Nebo Redline, which is a superb flashlight that I regard much more highly than my many Maglites. Recently, however, I managed to misplace both of my Redlines. Searching for a backup, I came across Nebo's CSI 8 tactical flash. Since it was priced around $13-14, I assumed that it was a very basic Nebo that couldn't really come close to the Redline. But I was in the mood to spend $14 more than I was in the mood to spend $25. And the flashlight WAS a Nebo. How bad could it be?Boy was I surprised. This model matches the Redline in many respects. Nebo can't possibly intend to keep the price this low. Here are some salient points by way of comparison:1. The light output of the Redline and the CSI 8 are about the same although the CSI 8 has eight LED's versus the Redline's one.2. The Redline can step through three power levels whereas the CSI 8 has only one. This is incidental for my purposes, but others may need all those levels.3. The Redline's bezel can be rotated to change the width of the beam. The CSI 8 does not have this functionality.4. Both models have an emergency flashing (strobe) function. Since I often have to walk in the dark on roadways that have minimal sidewalks, this is an important way for me to warn off approaching vehicles.5. Both models have an SOS function.6. Both models have a ""defensive"" front edge although I'm skeptical about this having any real effect on an attacker. If you want weaponry, get a big Maglite and use it as a club. I'll sell you mine.7. The Redline has a partially magnetized case, but the CSI 8 is not magnetized. Both cases are waterproofed aluminum.8. The CSI 8 has a red laser pointer. The Redline does not. I might Have a good use for this eventually.9. The CSI 8 comes with batteries, as does the Redline.Reviewers of Nebo models have sometimes pointed out that they aren't really good ""tactical"" flashlights. If you have reason to be fussy about that, then I suppose they're not. I just need a really bright flashlight to get to and from the car when it's dark (street lighting is not very good where I live, and the grounds around the house are pitch black at light) and to help me deal with traffic when I'm walking.The Redline and the CSI are both superb flashlights for the general user.

101654,"This is certainly a bright little light for its size and for the money.  It focuses tighter than any other light this size that I've seen.  Its multi-function switch makes it useful for a broad range of applications, and the fact that the switch glows in the dark is a nice touch.  The knurling provides a secure grip on the light, and at full power it is rated for four hours of light.  That jumps to 72 hours in the strobe and SOS modes.BUT, the switch takes a very firm effort to press, and it isn't always easy.  The ""red line"" feature around the head is annoying and I think I'll wrap some black electrical tape around that.  The flashlight will also automatically switch modes when you turn it on and off in short succession, so it is annoying to try to use the thing for one brief illumination after another.  You really need to leave it off for quite a while (30 seconds?  A full minute?) between uses, if you want the same setting when you turn it on again.I compared this light to some of my others and I have to doubt it produces an honest 220 lumens.

101655,"There are things about this light that you won't like once it arrives but I doubt you'll send it back. Honestly for the quality of the light you get out of this thing for $21 and some change you have to give it five stars even if you can find all these faults because the light is that good coming out of the end of it and as far as infinite adjustment of the beam well, I have not found anything that allows this much control outside a mag lite and you won't find it quite this nice in one of those.Now as for those small but annoying things!1)This light had so many sharp burs all around lens assembly when it arrived that I had to take a hand held diamond fish hook sharpener to it to trim them down. These burrs would certainly cut with enough pressure applied and maybe that is what it was left on there for but for the record I don't like it so I removed the sharp edges and those burrs formed from the machining of the grooving in the self defense apparatus of this light.2) You have to fumble through all the other settings to get to the one you want. It sucks but its not so bad other than perhaps undue wear on the switch.3) The light is big. Its a little giant really as its bigger around and longer than I imagined in pictures. Its not bad don't get me wrong, still much smaller than a large Mag Lite and way more light out of it but it is not a pocket light in my opinion. This is more akin to a duty light as opposed to a EDC.4) The button is an index finger only on off button. I can't even make it come on with my thumb.5) This is a big light with no lanyard, no pocket clip, and no carry case. Its not really even set up with any way of hooking it up to a lanyard which to me is a bit odd.Now for the good.The light is bright white. Judging the light based on just solely what comes out the end of it you can't argue and it will stand up to the best lights I've played with. On high it is a very impressive beam of light and on flood it will astound you at the truly impressive display of steady light to really bring a place to life. I love the adjustable beam feature this light brings to the table with the twist adjustment like my Maglites offer. That is like the mag lite only the light is much more impressive from this Nebo than any MagLite I have ever used. I can light the entire back yard with the Redline and although the BA20 by Jet Beam is brighter this light is slightly whiter so its a toss up as to which you might like. I favor the BA20 for size and ease of use but its priced higher so for the money this is a better buy and just as much light albeit in a different package.The magnet on the end is an interesting feature with this light. It sticks no problem to the fridge and it may be that for some jobs like working under the hood of the old truck or maybe underneath a crawl space when working on duct work this will be handy. I do like that it stands flat on its end and I like that it has a self defense purpose but honestly I really have trouble believing anyone could EDC (everyday carry) this light. Its too big!Lastly, the light is machined well and I do like the design as well as the easy instructions for functions printed right on the light. The parts fit well, it appears well done with top materials to me. I can't say I'm really a fan of the red stripe on this light but my wife thought it was cute.The button does glow in the dark and that is nice but I must say of all the lights I've played with lately this one has a button that is less worthy of praise than even some of the very cheap plastic lights you can buy.

That being said, even though the light is VERY bright, I still dont believe it is close to 220 lumens.  Probably more like 120 lumens.  I dont have a lumen tester, so this is merely a guess based on other LED flashlights I have, but you will still be happy with the performance.  Much, much better than anything sold at Home Depot or Lowe's.  Comes with AAA batteries, durable aluminum case, SOS and Strobe modes, and focusing beam settings.

101657,"I purchased this Nebo light at the same time as a Streamlight Strion LED 74301, a Streamlight Protac 2AA 88033, and a Fenix E21.  I already own a Mini-Maglight 3AA LED and have other LED flashlights.  I spent over 30 years in law enforcement and have relied heavily on flashlights.  Naturally, you usually get what you pay for, and this Nebo light was the least expensive of the Streamlights and Fenix.  It has some positive features such as being compact, very bright (on high settings), having an end cap switch, and having tactical edges for defense on either end.  The end cap is magnetic so it can be stuck to a car fender or other metal object, although I couldn't think of a situation where I would use that feature.When I first took it from the box I unscrewed the end to inspect the batteries.  The rubber o-ring that provides the seal for the end cap was broken and fell off.  I'll have to try to find another o-ring to fit if I wish to ensure water-tight integrity (Nebo does not include spares like Fenix does with the E21).  Also, while I like the five output settings (low, med, high, defense strobe, and SOS Morse code strobe), the memory feature for the last position is very flaky.  Instead of consistently recalling the last setting when switched on, it instead frequently goes to the next setting. So, if you last had the light on low, it will go to the SOS strobe the next time it is switched on.  I have to touch the end cap switch to cycle it back to the desired setting.  This problem is not something I'd want to fiddle with in a tactical situation. Finally, depending on your use, the red side light may be tactically undesirable as your position is illuminated to others from the right and left side.Overall, not terrible for the price, but I would not buy again.  Again, out of fairness, this one was the least expensive of those purchased. I'm just one who would spend more to get more.  This light is getting relegated to the glovebox in my wife's car.

The magnetic base is great when I'm working on equipment and need both hands. The batterys last much longer than my coast which burned through them once a week.

It's largest downfall would be the strobe. It's intended as a self defense feture but because you have to cycle all the other settings before you get to this one it kinda defeats the purpose.

But anyway, $90 for a 20Vmax cordless B&D; drill (18V under load) with 2 Li-ion batteries (plus soft case and double-ended bit) is a great buy.  Some other reviewers mentioned they found it cheaper elsewhere, but that drill is the previous model (no smart select) with only one battery...The time it takes to charge the battery is extraordinary (couple of hours or more), but with 2 batteries and a little bit of fore-planning you will be fine.  Anyway these batteries hold their charge for long time so you can charge them now, let them be, and use the drill weeks or months later with no problem (I imagine, I haven't had it for so long).  If you need faster charge times, get a DeWalt with 30-min quick charge (but also pay 2-3 times as much).The quality (although mostly plastic to keep the weight down) is nice and the drill appears sturdy, but only time will tell.  The chuck grips securely and I haven't noticed any slipping (although my larger drill bits have a 3-flat base - maybe there is slipping with traditional round-base drill bits).

The CAPSURE then displays the closest PMS solid or CMYK color.

101684,"The Pantone CAPSURE is an impressive little device.  Small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse, what it does is capture precisely any color you like.  It would be ideal for a designer or artist, and would make it possible to match a particular color out in nature or on a fabric or a wall to a specific paint shade or other design element.  It also makes it possible to be sure that the photographic or video image of a given tone or shade matches exactly.It's a very elegantly designed device, that's also very functional.  The slide-on lens cap also doubles as a calibration plate, so that every time you turn it on you can calibrate it to be sure that the measurements are exact.  You can record up to 100 different colors at a time before uploading them to the computer, and you can even add a brief audio reference to any given color so that you remember where it came from.  When you capture a swatch with multiple colors in it, the screen will give you up to four different options to choose from - and once you have a color the device will display and allow you to record colors that are similar or even complementary in tone.  The colors you capture are referenced both by their Pantone names (and there are several Pantone libraries to choose from) as well as their precise number in all of the major color spaces (sRGB, Adobe RGB, HTML, Lab, and XYZ values).The LCD screen is large enough to see quite clearly the colors you capture (and will also display a photo image of whatever real swatch you have it pointed to).  It's got a rechargeable battery, that lasts a long time; it comes with a handsomely designed case.  It fits nicely in the hand, and there's a convenient wrist strap.  Obviously, this is a high end specialty device.  It's well designed and works great.  For those who need it, it's well worth the price (especially when the alternative is buying and maintaining expensive libraries of color samples and swatches).",5.0,1,"[0.40625, 0.1375, 0.18833333333333332, 0.33749999999999997, 0.375, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13954081632653062, 0.225, 0.6, 0.08, 0.8, -0.06666666666666667]",1,1

101686,"The Pantone CAPSURE is a portable colorimiter - you hold it up against a surface, press the side button, and in a few seconds it will read the color and tell you which Pantone color it comes closest to.  But more than that, it will tell you CMYK, RGB, HTML and Lab color values.  But the real trick is when you ask it to look at a sample that has multiple colors - it will pull out up to four colors and give you the matching information for each one.When you press the side button half-way, you see a preview of the surface in the small LCD screen with a crosshair indicating the center.  By default, it automatically picks the ""aperture"" or sample size, but you can manually select that if you want.  Press the button the rest of the way, and it takes the reading.The CAPSURE stores up to 100 samples, each saved with a date/time stamp.  You can also add a ""voice tag"" as well as a text tag, though entering the latter is probably too annoying to be useful.  When you connect the CAPSURE to your computer via the included USB cable, it saves your scans to the computer.  This is also how you update the CAPSURE's firmware and install additional color decks.  It comes with 15 of various kinds, but many more are available for purchase. I note that there are a variety of paint brands available, but neither Behr nor Benjamin Moore, the brands I tend to use most.If this was all the CAPSURE did, it would be a lot, but there's more. You can ask the CAPSURE to show you similar or coordinating colors.  There is a small LCD screen but the colors it displays are not always accurate, so you should verify against your Pantone fans.  The CAPSURE has a built-in calibration target, and it will ask you to recalibrate often - especially if the temperature changes more than 5 degrees.I tried the CAPSURE on various surfaces, and it consistently worked well, though the screen's depiction of the color didn't quite match what my eyes showed, which is probably because the closest Pantone match wasn't the exact color.Also included is CAPSURE Palette software.  This is where you find the recorded samples from the CAPSURE but it is a delightful tool all on its own.  Right click on one of your samples in the Palette software and select ""Go to bridged color"".  It will show you many similar Pantone colors if you want something ""a little more yellow"", etc.  Another feature of Palette I like is the ability to sample a color in a digital image and do the same as with a captured sample - find the closest Pantone match and find similar colors.  You can create custom palettes with selected colors, but note that creating a palette is the only way to keep the CAPSURE-sampled information as otherwise it may get overwritten by later samples on the device.Some additional things: A rugged carrying case with a belt clip is included, as is a wrist lanyard.  The CAPSURE recharges from a USB port and turns off automatically after a couple of minutes of not being used to save the battery.  The one thing I haven't been able to figure out is what the purpose is of the circular ""window"" above the screen.  This is not mentioned in the manual and might be only decorative - it isn't for admitting light because the CAPSURE relies on its own lighting.If you are a graphic artist, decorator, or anyone who works with color on a daily basis, you will find the Pantone CAPSURE a tremendous help to your work.

101700,"Fenix 15I have reviewed many flashlights and I recommend the Fenix TK series of lights, They are bright, have multiple levels of light, and rugged. Operating the flashlight is simple ,just press the rubber button on the end of the flashlight, To turn it on keep pressing it until you have the desired light output. The strobe function is operated by pressing the silver button near the flashlight head.While no flashlight will meet everyone's  need the TK15  with 337 lumens of lights will definitely light your way. There are four levels of lights ranging from  general, turbo, and strobe. There are occasions when the maximum 337 lumens is too much so you can turn down the light output.The TK15 uses a Cree XP-Gr5 LED. which  Fenix says the LED t will last for 100,000 hours which is  over 11 years of continuous use.The flashlight has just the right of amount of weight at 4.7 oz without the battery. The TK-15  comes with a holster, lanyard and  spare O rings which keep the unit waterproof. However  no battery is included.The body is made  of aircraft-grade aluminum.  I  had to research "" aircraft grade aluminum"" which is simply an aluminum alloy. Magnesium  is usually added to the aluminum to make it lighter and more heat resistant. On the flashlight body there is a heat symbol. I was curious about why a heat symbol would be on a LED flashlight.  I thought  a LED doesn't  make heat. I  asked someone in the industry and he told me it is the circuitry that generates the heat. The flashlight case is designed as a heat sink to remove the heat from the inside of the flashlight.The TK15 flashlight is powered by a choice of  one 18650 battery or two CR123A batteries. I recommend 18650 batteries because  they are lithium and can be recharged countless times. CR123A batteries  can be used also but they are expensive and not always readily available. I had a tough time finding them recently. They were once common when widely used in cameras.The TK-15 is a reliable flashlight.

What is nice is you can play with how dim you actually want the light to be.  While some dimmers may make a LED or CFL off at its lowest setting, you can calibrate the switch to adjust how bright the lowest setting actually is.The only Con i can think of is its price.  The switch is a bit costly, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but it works perfectly with all the CFL and LED lights I am using currently, so it was well worth it for me.So if you want a dimmer for LED/CFL bulbs you may want to try this dimmer out.

The very interesting part is that as you can see, there are no visible screws.  Most switches require you to screw the switch into the wall box with 2 screws, then afterwards you have to install the plate onto the switch with 2 more screws - which can be sort of dumb sometimes.  For example, all the lighting plates in my current house are a dark brown color.  Well, you can easily tell that I have lost a few screws because you can plainly see a chrome screw on the brown switch plate.  And I can't simply paint over the screw - the plates are a wierd rustic color which has a faded look (as opposed to a solid color).

The top is a little too big for my taste. It can make edge sanding a little awkward. Not much though and I'm pretty sure I'll grow accustomed to it. The one thing that really irritates me is the button. My last sander had a hard button that was easy to feel and use. This one has a rubber guard over it. The rubber makes it very difficult to feel and press the switch fully.

101820,"First, thank you to those who gave hints and less than positive reviews - it tempered my expectations.  Even more important, they gave the hint to let the sander ""break in"" before sanding.For break in, I just let the sander run at a variety of speeds for about 10 minutes.  Much to my surprise, the sander made a fair amount of dust that built up around the outside of the sanding pad on the yellow case of the sander.  This helped to lessen what seemed to be excessive pressure between the back of the sanding pad and the ""seal"" to the body of the sander (this white ring is important to stop free spinning of the pad when running but not against a work surface).  This seemed to do the trick since I experience none of the negatives that others experienced with stalled sanding or leaving marks on the workpiece.My previous electric sander experience includes a Milwaukee 1/4 sheet and Black & Decker Industrial (which turned into DeWalt) random orbit.  I recently learned that it is important to leave the sander sitting upside down or right side up.  Laying on the side will break the sanding pad - this was the demise of the 15+ year old Black & Decker.  Replacement pads seem to cost about $25 which counted for a nice discount on the new sander!What I like about the D26456:Smooth power.  The brushless motor is a great development.  Although as a DIY'er, it's unlikely that brushes will ever wear out, the lack of carbon brush dust and the difference in motor sound makes the tool feel really high-end.Variable Speed.  Single speed was never a problem in the past but being able to dial the aggressiveness of sanding beyond just changing grit is nice.Durability.  Of course, time will be the true test but based on similar tools, the case should be very drop resistant and the cord is a much higher quality than what comes on light duty tools.  (also a questionable area - see below)Low profile.  Having a shorter sander really does work better.Good dust collection.  Even better than the old Black & Decker despite very similar design.  The D26456 will even allow a vacuum hose to attach without any extra adapters needed.Questionable areas:Like others, I found the top of the sander to be rather large in the hand.  With the different motor design, the tool also lacks the skinny waist that many other sanders have.The switch and speed control seem to be open to dust ingress.  Many other sanders have rubber boots over the top of the switch to keep dust out.  Maybe this tool has a less obvious way to seal out dust?  If not, the life of the tool will not be very good.With the smooth sound and power, I'm happy with this purchase even though the ergonomics of holding the sander are not the absolute best.  Hopefully, brushless motors make their way into more power tools (they seem to have taken the remote control toy world with no regrets).",4.0,1,"[0.10353535353535354, 0.45, 0.22499999999999998, 0.11000000000000001, -0.008333333333333304, 0.13253968253968254, -0.033333333333333326, 0.37878787878787873, 0.8, 0.020000000000000007, 0.19464285714285715, 0.24000000000000005, -0.25, 0.4666666666666666, 0.10833333333333334, 0.041190476190476194, 0.09375, 0.2916666666666667, -0.08333333333333333, 0.6183333333333333, 0.15]",1,1

101823,I bought this sander to replace a Ridgid variable speed ROS that stopped working. This sander like other reviews state is a bit large for comfortable one handed operation. The power cord is much shorter than the sander it replaced which I came to love and it is average for stock removal and final finish capabilities. For $100 I would expect more. If I were to do it over again I would buy the Ridgid variable speed ROS and make sure to register the warranty as I didn't on the previous sander. The Ridgid also connected very snug to the vacuum hose I use for dust collection and while the Dewalt seems to have the same style connector it fits loosely translating to having to hold the hose or using just the passive dust bag on the sander itself. I build furniture and cabinetry for a living and a vacuum hookup is extremely beneficial for both your health and time savings of not having to clean up as often. I also use a Bosch sander for most of my work but it is a two handed sander so I have the need for a one handed sander a lot for finesse stuff. and this one is not what I had hoped but will work for now until I find a suitable replacement.

I am very happy with it.  It fits my hand very well and is comfortable to use, much like the air powered unit I own.  I like the hook/loop paper attachment and the size.I really like the dust collection, but if you plan to do a lot of sanding you might want to invest in a dust collection system,  The bag fills pretty quickly, which means it is collecting a lot of the dust, not all the dust, but a lot.The sander could use to be heavier.  This seems an odd statement since every one wants lighter.  In this case the sander seems to have a little mind of its own when on a flat surface.  The orbital action makes the sander want move about the work piece in random directions.  If it was heavier the orbital action wouldn't be such a factor in influencing where it goes on the work piece.  Don't take this observation as a negative, it isn't, just an observation and product improvement suggestion  I compare this with its air powered cousin which is a bit heavier, and is less influenced by the orbital action on the work piece.

101839,"After living with this LED bulb for a week, I feel that it is very dim. E12 bulbs are hard to find in LED and most (like this one) are only 2 watts. Unlike other reviews, I do not hear a buzzing sound from the bulb.  Its made very well, but the light output isn't really a warm white (more of a bright white almost blue white). This LED bulb is actually the equivalent to a 15 watt incandescent bulb. The bulbs fit nicely in my ceiling fan (with candelabra sockets), if you are okay with such a dim light. It is a directional bulb, meaning it works best in a fixture pointing up or down.  My ceiling fan has sockets that hold the bulb sideways, so the position of the bulb might be affecting the light quality.  There is a short delay when turning on the light, so you don't get that ""instant on"" of an incandescent bulb.  I am going to try a socket adapter to fit a regular E26 LED bulb in my ceiling fan. I am hoping that will be much brighter.Some words of advice on LED bulbs:I recently switched out every bulb in my house to LED bulbs. Originally I thought I could easily switch out every light in my house to the same LED bulb, but I quickly learned that not all LED bulbs are created equal or are honest in their claims. Each fixture in my home has a different brand of bulb, since every bulb produces a different quality of light. I had grown accustom to a specific quality of light in various areas of my house, which made picking the right LED very challenging. Outfitting your house with LED bulbs requires you to analyze where you want the most light and where you need ""mood"" lighting. Many LED bulbs produce great dim ""mood"" lighting at very low prices. These are areas of your house are where you can save money when buying LED bulbs. Multi-directional bulbs cost significantly more, so be very specific where you need that kind of bulb before buy one for every fixture in your house. Unlike incandescent lights, most LED bulbs have a slight delay when turning on. Once on the bulb is instantly bright, unlike fluorescence bulbs that take time to warm up. I found that some places of my house, I needed that ""instant on"" from the LED bulb (example: closet or bathroom). A good rule of thumb, most LED bulbs that claim to be dimmable usually are instant on too. I don't have any dimmers in my house, but the instant on was important. Not only do LED bulbs use less electricity, but they put off almost no heat. This has made a huge difference in the temperature of my house, especially during the hot Texas summer. Fun fact: 80% of the energy used by an incandescent bulb produces heat not light.",3.0,1,"[0.13, 0.06944444444444443, 0.1375, 0.16666666666666666, 0.0, 0.3333333333333333, 0.4222222222222222, 0.4, 0.13333333333333333, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3059523809523809, 0.13333333333333333, 0.2671428571428572, 0.45, 0.35000000000000003, 0.0, 0.3666666666666667, 0.16666666666666669, 0.65, 0.0, 0.2375, 0.2, -0.08333333333333333, 0.2166666666666667, 0.04999999999999999]",1,1

101841,"These LED bulbs are great in most respects: 3000K (nice white) color, only 2.5 watts, and actually enough light for a directed reading lamp. We have developed a lighting strategy that includes a lot of low watt LEDs to save energy. When we need a lot of light for entertaining we turn them all on (many sconces and chandeliers help this work), but in day-to-day life we just use a little light exactly where we need it.

Many others in our collection are rated at 30,000 to 40,000 hours.These are only rated at 15,000 hours, reputedly because they are over burning some cheaper LEDs.
